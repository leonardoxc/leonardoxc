CSS Sprite Generator is written and maintained by Ed Eliot, Stuart Colville & Cyril Doussin.

Software Requirements
---------------------

* Apache
* Mod Rewrite (optional)
* PHP 5.2 or above (with Imagick or GD 2)
* Image Magick binary (optional)
* Command line ZIP binary
* OptiPNG (optional)

If Image Magick isn't present the tool falls back to GD 2 (bear in mind output quality won't be as good).

Set Up
------

1. Copy "spritegen" directory to your server.
2. Set up new Apache virtual host and configure document root to point to "htdocs" (preferably other files should not be accessible via the web server).
3. Optionally add mod rewrite rules to Apache virtual host config (see "setup/spritegen.conf" for an example Apache virtual host config).
4. Update values in "includes/conf/app.inc.php" to suit your environment. Once configured set $aConfig['setup'] = true;
4. Ensure Apache can write to the cache folders you've specified in "includes/conf/app.inc.php".
5. Load in browser and enjoy it!
