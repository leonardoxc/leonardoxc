Changelog:


2007.03.21 *****************

- modified the support for Maxpunkte uploads. It can now work with Maxpunkte 5.1 beta 1
  which will prefer a smaller "free distance" score if this gives > 15km instead of a 
  triangle solution with more points but < 15 km

- Better glider brand detection

- Added hanglider brands and icons

- Added 2 user settings in "my settings" stored in the cookie
  1) toogle google maps on/off
  2) order of displaying the names -> fist name / last name or  last name / fist name

- Changed the cookie method , it should now work ok

- Some changes in handling names from different charsets , which is not important for DHV leonardo

- When a user adds a takeoff , and omits either "local" or "international-english" name 
  it is auto-copied from the name he provided. i.e if he only gives the german name leonardo
  sets the international name equal to the german one.
- In some apache/php configuration the storing of leonardo cookies wouldn't work as indented. Fixed this


2007.03.19 *****************

- fixed the validation bugs (spaces in the igc filename, flights added didnt get 
  validated automatically only after being edited)  Now the files are getting validated 
  right on submission but even if this fails , a check is made every time the flight is 
  displayed and a validation is tried on the fly. 
  See also the admin menu -> "update g-record validation" to update all flights with unknown status

- added a calendar in "list flights" to sleect individual days

- added czech language (thx to Peter Volf volfik@yahoo.com)

- added direct upload from maxpunkte

- added pre-optimized igc file support ( files ending in .olc)

- fixed the "more than 3 photos" bug

- added some more security in the files that get uploaded to the server 
  (i.e. before someone could upload a php file and execute arbitary code) 

- added romanian language (thx Chyp Rian chyprian@yahoo.com )
