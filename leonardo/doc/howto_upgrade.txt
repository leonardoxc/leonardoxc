UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS:

UPGRADE instructions:
1) unzip the new version in the modules dir but not in dir leonardo/ but something other like  leo/
2) run the provided SQL on your main DB. ALL SQL upgrades are HARMLESS to existing data AND functionality
3) MOVE the

flights/
maps/
site/
data/

files from the leonardo/ dir to leo/ (no backup is really needed)
4) by this time your new version will be available at /modules.php?name=leo.
5) rename leonardo/ to leonardo_old/ ?(or anything you wish)
6) rename leo/  to leonardo/ and you are done!
7) test all features on new version, if big problems, revert to old by using the steps in reverse order. (NO NEED TO REVERSE SQL commands)

This is a fail safe method, no need to duplicate/backup db, no data can be lost, the 2 versions can also run in paralell  using the same db but storing flights in different place ( not recommended !!!!)
