  <h1><b>Leonardo &quot;A</b><b>irspace checking&quot;</b></h1>
  <h1>1.&nbsp; Import of &quot;openair files&quot;</h1>
  <p>The admin must put the openair file (for example &quot;Air_Europe 2006.txt&quot;)
    in the leonardo/data/airspace directory.<br>
  (and creat this dir if it doesnt exist). </p>
  <p>Then from the top menu -&gt; &quot;Admin&quot;-&gt; &quot;Administer Airspace checking&quot; and </p>
  <p>1) &quot; Delete all airspace entries in the DB &quot; to be sure no previous data
    exist, if it is the first run or you want to start all over.</p>
  <p>2) Click on the &quot;Update / Import airspace into DB&quot; next to the airspace
    file. This may take from 5 to 20 secs. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>NOTE: you can &quot;Update / Import airspace into DB&quot; the same file
    over and over again, if the airspace names are the same in the new/updated
    file<br>
    the comments you have inserted in the DB will be preserved. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>2. Use</h1>
  <p>Airspace checking is automatic on flight submission. No message is displayed
    to the end user.</p>
  <p>On the flight list, flights with airspace violations have the last column
    with a differfent background. </p>
  <p>Also the initials of the &quot;checker&quot; are displayed if any.</p>
  <p>Flights that havent been checked on submission (because they were submitted
  before this functionallity became available) are  checke when ever the &quot;edit
  flight&quot; or the &quot;show flight&quot; screen are displayed. In the &quot;edit flight&quot; more
    info is displayed about the &quot;check&quot; and the admin has the option of manually
    making the check &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot;</p>
  <p>Also by setting the option to &quot;Not yet proccessed&quot; and pressing &quot;submit
    changes&quot; he will force the re-checking of the flight on the next time he
    enters this screen.</p>
  <p>He can also enter his initials or a comment in the relevant field. He can
    enter for example &quot;SJ Premission for airspace was granted&quot;. In the flight
    list only the first part till the first space will be displayed ie &quot;SJ&quot;</p>
  <p>The vertical height inside the airspace area is always computed as the minimum
    one between &quot;base&quot; and &quot;top&quot;. For example a flight inside an airspace of
    base=1000m and top=2000m with a gps point having alitude1100 will produce
    a 100m vertical violation. A point of 1900m will also produce a 100m violation </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>3. Disabling an airspace area.</h1>
  <p>In the "update Comments" subwindow there is a "disable area" checkbox.<br>
You just check it and press "update". The now "disabled" area will still be listed in the flight <br>
(marked as disabled but still invalidating the flight) until a new recheck is forced. <br>
When the re-check is forced the "disabled" area will disappear from the list.<br>
<br>
If this area was violated with other flights also, it will remain and invalidate these flights till a re-check is done for them.<br>
<br>
There is no option to delete an area from within the interface, if there REALLY a need to do so instead of "disable" it<br>
the admin can delete the DB record directly. It is however adviced to use the "disable" functinality because it persists<br>
(together with the "Comments" field) through new airspace file update. This means that if the new airspace file is imported <br>
the next year, areas that were deleted will re-enter the DB where as  "disabled" areas will remain disabled (if they still exist in the new  file).<br>
<br>
All disabled areas are listed in the "Adminster Airspace checking" so the admin can edit their comments or re-activate them.<br>
By re-activating an area all flights that violated this area must be manually be re-checked.  </p>
