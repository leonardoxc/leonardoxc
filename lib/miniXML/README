MiniXML provides a simple API to generating and parsing XML with 2 implementations:
- a 100% PHP implementation
- a set of Perl modules.

Either of the implementations may be used seperately.

It's advantages are ease-of-use and the fact that no additional libraries 
are required (a single "include"/"use" is all you need). 

MiniXML provides classes for XML documents and elements.

There is some example PHP and Perl code in the docs directory but the full API, 
an overview and example code are all available on the official website at:
