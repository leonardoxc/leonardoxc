Add support for initial question for unknown hosts.

This is not as simple as it seems, and may require some thought. It may
pose serious security problems. In principle one might use -O and the
appropriate options to disable host checking, but then we wouldn't be
notified of changes.

OTOH, if we are, what should we do? Fail? That we already do (albeit without
explanatory messages, true). Ask the user? He may not know anything about
the remote host. Accept? Then we won't notice possible break-ins.

Possibly the best option is to just fail as we already do and let the
programmer/service installer take care of it.

A note explaining how to deal with the issue should and MUST be added.
