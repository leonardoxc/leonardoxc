25 Nov 2003 JpGraph 1.14
========================

Improved error handling:
------------------------

* [me] Added extended error check in AccBar and GroupBar so that user
  gets a warning if non-bar objects is used as arguments.

* [me] Added error check for invalid specified graph canvas size

* [me] Added additional error check for wrong argument s for CSIM targets and
  texts for Gantt charts.

* [me] Added error check for Gantt graph when user specifies negative image
  sizes and at the same time introduce backward compatibility with sizes
  specified as -1 to indicate auto-sizing.

* [me] Added error check for headers already sent before trying to send 
  image headers. This will now give a good and informative error mesage
  to help begnners understand why they can't mix text and image data in the
  same HTTP stream.

* [me] Imroved error handling to catch abnormal in-data to the library
  to avoid internal PHP errors.

* [me] Added error check against non-numeric data values in bar plot.

* [me] Added error check for trying to load a background image in a 
  non-supported image format.

* [me] Added error check for illegal data for log scale and not only an
  assert() statment.

Bug fixes
---------

* [me] Fixed a typo in jpgraph_stock.php that casued wrong automatic
  coloring when open < close.

* [me] Cleaned up old residues in CSIM examples in the Example/ directory so
  they work fine with the current version of the library.

* [me] Fix a problem with handling Daylight Savings Time for the scales
  with Gantt charts. (If the switchover date (depending on the locale) 
  was somewhere in between start and end date then the 1 hour off would
  result in wrong date alignments.)

* [me] Fixed typo in image format checking which resulted in a false
  positive for JPEG format for an installation that doesn't support JPEG

* [me] Fixed color wrap around problem for pie's if you supply fewer colors
  than slices.

* [me] Fixed a rounding problem which could cause a 1 pixel overshoot for
  gradient MIDVER and MIDHOR types if the distance between the edges was
  not a multiple of 2.

* [me] Fix for a problem were legends where in incorrect order if you added
  more legends than slices in a pie plot.

* [me] Updated piec_csimex1.php since it used an obsolete function and fonts. 


Various feature enhancements
----------------------------

* [me] Added FF_CHINESE/FF_BIG5 which makes it possible to automatically get 
  BIG5->UTF8 conversion. The Chinese font file is by default bkai00mp.ttf but
  can easily be changed by setting the 'CHINESE_TTF_FONT define.

* [me] Added possibility to add one or several Logo's to the graph by adding a
  new 'semi' plot type "IconPlot()" which can be added to the graph using the 
  normal Graph::Add(). The icon plot can also be one of the supported 
  country flags.

* [me] Visual adjustment of graphical error handler

* [me] Added simple line patterns as fill options for bar plots. See
  barpatternex1.php for an example.

* [me] Added Text::SetWordwrap() to allow wordrap n text paragraph.

* [me] Added Graph::Set3DPerspective() This allows a fake "3D-perspective"
  distorsion, this is all done with a shearing transformation. Since this is
  all done in PHP code (we don't get any help from GD here) this is somewhat
  processor intensive. After all, this is real image processing we are doing
  in plain old PHP.

* [jigal] Improved way to auto detect GD version.

* [me] Added the possibility to do "fake" 3D perspective post processing of
  the graph by adding Graph::Set3DPerspective() to all relevant graphs.

* [me] Fine tuning of positiong of text wthin it's box for StrokeBoxedText()

* [me] Added SetGridDepth() functionlity to Radar graph. This way you can
  control with a call to Graph::SetGridDepth() if the axis and grids should
  be on top of or behind the radar plot.

* [me] Workaround for a floating point comparison bug in PHP. In some 
  circumstances the comparison $x > $y is true even when $x == $y. The
  workaround  is to write the comparison as !( $x <= $y )

* [me] Add error check in Set90AndMargin() to make sure a scale have been
  specified.

* [me] Improved positioning of displayed values for horizontal bar graphs.

* [me] The automatically generated file name for cached images now
  includes the query string to the script. (Based on a suggestion 
  made by Christer Oterhals)

* [me] Added jpgraph_imgtrans.php to make it possible to do some simple
  image transformation which will make a "flat" 3D perspective transformation
  of an Gd image.

* [me] Behaviour change. 0 values are not printed for individual 0 in an
  accumulated bar plot. 

* [me] Added possibility to use country flags as background images with the
  method Graph::SetBackgroundCountryFlag()

* [me] Added Graph::SetBackgroundImageMix() to specify how much (in percent)
  the background image should be merged

* [me] Added Image::CopyMerge()


23 Aug 2003 JpGraph 1.13
========================
* [me] Added Gradient line fill for line plots. See gradlinefillex1.php

* [me] Fix bug #140. A rounding problem in Gradient fill which
  in some circumstances could cause a 2 pixels overflow in the filling.

* [me] Added option to let the user setup if the PHP error handler should
  give an image with the error message. Useful during development. 
  Controlled by the define INSTALL_PHP_ERR_HANDLER

* [me] Added method Legend::SetReverse() to reverse the order of plots in 
  the Legend.

* [me] Since the example directory is now getting to big the example directory
  is now split into several subdirectories depending on Graph type.

* [me] Added more Gantt chart examples.

* [me] Adjusted size for filled circles (as used for example in markers). By a
  type they were previously 2 pixels to large copared to what they were
  specified to be

* [me] Fix for annoyance #147, #150. Fine tuning of legend layout and positioning of
  markers. It should now look even better with some better calculated margins
  and general positioning that depends on the actual markers use for the plots.

* [me] Fix (bug?) #134. Don't output any coordinates for bar CSIM if the target is an
  empty string.

* [me] Fix bug #133. Fill colors for individual bars was not honoured when
  used together with an accumulated bar. 

* [me] Fix bug #136. Labels for 2D pie does not follow start label when
  anti-alias is enabled.

* [me] Feature request #154. Make it possible to use object methods as
  callbacks wherever callbacks can be specified in the library

* [me] Fix problem #152. Values for PiePlotC wasn't parsed for
  printf-formatting. (A bug that was introduced with AntiAlising in 1.12)

* [me] Fix problem #148. Explode array was specified clockwise while slices
  are specified anti-clockwise. 
  NOTE: THIS GIVES THE WRONG LOOK ON EXISTING 2D PIE PLOTS WITH EXPLODEDED
  SLICES SINCE THE WRONG SLICE WIll NOW BE EXPLODED

* [me] Updated class reference

* [me] Make colors have the same order in both 2D and 3D pie plots

* [me] Added possibility to make PiePlot percentage adjustment so that 
  integer percetage will add up to 100%. This is done by the Hare/Niemeyer
  method. To activate the percetage adjustment you need to specify labeltype
  of 2, as in $pieplot->SetLabeltype(2),

* [me] Y2 scale can now add lines, texts and band through a single call to
  Graph::AddY2() in exactly the same way as Graph::Add()

* [me] Make sure there are no direct calls to GD except through the Image class

* [me] Make it possible to rotate polar graphs 90 degrees with Set90AndMargin()

* [me] Major improvements in the Gantt charts. 
  1. Now support for minute and hour scale as well
  2. Suport for multiple columns in the title field, you can now have (for
     example) Start date, end date, duration etc
  3. Improved sizing to make the overall image as small as possible
  4. Make it possible to use builtin or file based icons in the title columns
  5. Improved 3D look & feel
 
* [me] Added support for using country flags as image markers. This
  is added by jpgraph_flags.php together with the image files *.dat
  At the moment 229 countries are supported. See Example/listallflags.php
  for a current list of supported countries. All flags are available in 4
  standard original sizes, as markers they may also be arbitrary scaled.
  For a simple example see Examples/markflagex1.php

* [ryleyb] Multiple constrains for Gantt graphs

* [me] Added possibility to use the Free Vera TTF font. The font is available
  from http://www.gnome.org/fonts/

* [me] Make PHP deault error handler show image if possible

* [me] Improved look for image error handler (added icon)

* [me] Fixed problem with gradient backgrounds for horizontal 
  bar graphs.

* [me] Added possibility of 'max' value position for bar graphs. This
  positions the value just inside tha bar at the max value of the bar.

* [me] Font files are now fully specified in the setup and doesn't assume an
  extension of ttf.

30 May 2003 JpGraph 1.12.2
===========================
* [me & A. Tang] Added support for Chinese font and character handling.
  This requires you to install the "simhei.ttf" Chinese font. 

* [J Sweat] Fix bug [#124] Make step line style ignore NULL values in data

* [J Sweat] Fix bug [#123] Divide by zero for line length of zero for dashed lines

* [me] Fix bug [#109]. Problem with pie color when a supplied color array
  contains more colors than data. For anti-aliased images that meant that
  the last n colors was used and not the first n colors.

* [me] For plotmarks that use the ALT string the wrong value was in due
  to the recent addition of both Y and X value to control the plot callback. 
  This has now been fixed so that it will work as before and that previous
  code that assumes one parameter in their ALT srting will see the Y-value at
  the plotmar. New is also that the X-value is given as a second
  parameter. This means that the ALT string can display both the Y and X value
  for a specific point.
 
* [me] Make it possible to disable individual plot legends through the method
  Plot::HideLegend() 

* [me] Fixed problem with SetTextTickInterval() together with grouped bars
  (bug #116)

* [me] Fixed a problem with shadows on accumulated bar plots (bug #111)

* [me] Fixed Legend::SetMarkAbsSize() 

* [me] Add error check for the case that the server (Windows) 
  doesn't support SystemRoot and TEMP server variables.

* [me] Fix short-open-tags bug that made it's way into 1.12.1 (bug #121)

* [me] Make sure we only pass integers into GD when positioning texts.

* [me] Always treat "" (empty string) as NULL for bar plots

* [me] Allow links from vertical position 0 on gantt charts


12 Apr 2003 JpGraph 1.12.1
==========================

* [me] Added Legend::SetLineSpacing() to control the vertical line
  distcance (in pixels) between legend texts.

* [me] Compensate for bug in imagecopyresampled() in GD 2.01.
  This made clipping unusable with GD 2.01

* [me] Added LinePlot::SetFillFromYMin() to make the fill start from
  the bottom of a Y-scale with negative values rather than the 0-value
  which is now the case.

* [me] Fix a problem with legend box layout in the case of TTF fonts
  and different lengths of individual texts. The layout engine now
  work out each column individually. This will also give the legend
  box the minimum possible size.

* [me] Compensate for possible bug in strtok() when parsing color
  specification as a string with adjustment factors. 


06 Apr 2003 JpGraph 1.12
========================
* [me] Added possibility to specify the position of the legend box
  with absolute pixels coordinates not only as fractinos as before.

* [me] Improved legend layout. It is now possible to specify
  the number of columns in the legend box. The preferred way of
  specifyin the layout is now Legend::SetColumns(). The oild
  way with SetLayout() is still available for backwards compatibility
  reasons. The old vertical layout corresponds to a 1 column
  layout (SetColumns(1) which is also the default).

* [me] Added possibility to specify text string position 
  using scale coordinates onto the plot by adding 
  Text::SetScalePos(). The autoscaling has been modifyied to
  be aware of the text scale positions.

* [me] Added builtin images for plotmarks. This also meant a
   refactoring exercise for the PlotMark class and it has now been
   split in sevaral files.

* [me] Added footer capability to Radar, Pie and Gantt charts

* [me] Improved upon rounding problem with GD2 and pie slices
       (defect #88)

* [me] Take shadow color as specified with Graph::SetShadow() into account.

* [me] Don't rotate the footer if the graph is rotated. 

* [me] Added Axis::HideLabels()

* [me] Adjusted of the automatic margin calculation so that it is
  aware of when the x-axis have been hidden.

* [me] Added PlotMark::SetCallbackYX(), This allows for the
  specification of a callback function which is given both X and Y
  coordinates. Also extended the returned values from the callback so
  that image in a marker can be dynamically modified both size and
  actual image file used. This will enable the use of advanced
  "push-pin" graphs. For example adding markers to a background image
  map of certain size and type. 

  For backwards compatibility any callback specified with
  PlotMark::SetCallback() will not be given the extra parameter. So
  old code does not need to be changed.

* [me] Fixed handling of PHP array URL parameters with CSIM. [Bug #82] 

* [me] Added Legend::SetFrameWeight() which adjusts the frame around
  the legend. Legend::SetLineWeight() now works as documented and sets
  the line weight for the markers instead.

* [me] Autoscaling will now also take the value of added lines into account.

* [me] Fixed problem with horizontal legend box becomming too small
  for many legends.

* [me] Radar plot. SetColor() always sets a fill color. Fixed (Bug #83)

* [me] Added SetWidth() for tab-title. The tab can now easily extend
  over the entire plot width. Added SetPos() as synonym in tab title
  for SetTabAlign().

* [me] Gradient bar plots now show a gradient mark in the legend

* [me] PiePlot3D::SetSliceColors() now more correctly specifies the
  color anti-clockwise. The same order that slices are drawn.

* [me] Pie position can now also be specified in absolute pixels
  in PiePlot::SetCenter()

* [me] Added Bevel frame for entire graph

* [me] Added possibility for some more advanced Graph title
  formatting through the Graph::SetTitleBackground() method.

* [me] Type safe comparison in auto-detection of GD version

* [me] Added Graph::SetCanvasColor() to specify the background color
  the canvas is initialized with.

* [me] Fine tuned label positiong for pie labels and made 3D pies
  take the specified labels into account.

* [me] Added Anti-aliasing to Pie charts. Looks good but it really
  slows down the pie generation. Enable by acalling
  PieGraph::SetAntiAliasing()

* [me] Ignore NULL values in Stock and bar plots

* [me] Some minor internal adjustments for rounding in log scales.


2 Feb 2003 JpGraph 1.11
=======================
* [Martijn] Compensate for GD 2.x bug in filledarc() which doesn't
  like negative angles.

* [me] Added Graph::SetBackgroundGradient() . This allows 
  a gradient to be used as a background. The gradient can either fill
  the whole frame, only the margin or just the plot area. See the
  class reference or the manual for details regarding this method.

* [me] Modified adjustment factor for colors so that it now
  is linear between dark and light, i.e. a factor of 1 is the original
  color, a factor of 0 is black and a factor of 2 is white. 

* [me] Added two new gradient style GRAD_LEFT_REFLECTION and
  GRAD_RIGHT_REFLECTION 

* [me] Some fine tuning of text layout in legend box

* [me] Radar plots can now have a background image and multiple
  titles (sub-title, and subsub title). 
  Added RadarGraph::SetPos() as alias for 
  RadarGraph::SetCenter().

* [me] Fixed a small pre-read-loop error which could casue the
  X-gridline to be outside the right edge of the plotarea if the
  X-scale was indented.

* [me] Added possibility to use (scaled) images as markers by
  introductin the new mark type MARK_IMG.

* [me] Added tab titles for graphs. See class reference and Example
  tabtitleex1.php.

* [me] Added filled grids by adding method Grid::SetFill(). This new
  feature is illustrated in example filledgridex1.php. Documented in
  section 6.2.11 in the manual.

* [me] Improved automatic margins so they adapt to one or more title
  lines automatically. 

* [me] Fixed a class hierachy bug. RotImage::DashedLine() should not be
  implemented but rather rely on the Image::DashedLine() since the
  rotation will happen in the RotImage::Line() which gets called in
  Image::DashedLine() by any istance of RotImage().
  You could see the ffect of this by trying to create a 90 degrees
  rotated graph with dashed gridlines, they would appear not to be
  rotated at all where in fact they were rotated twice.

* [me] Added automatic default margins when using Set90AndMargin()

* [me] Added Box plots which is a variant of Stock charts with the
  possibility to add the median as a horizontal line in the box. 

* [me] Added Stock charts, (aka candle-bars) as new class StockPlot().
  added example stockplotex1.php in the Example directory.

* [me] Added two new axis styles AXSTYLE_YBOXOUT, AXSTYLE_BOXIN which
  suplicates the Y-axis on both sides but not the X-axis.

* [me] Set90AndMargin() now also adjusts the label alignment on the
  axis to suit the rotation.

* [me] Added class LineErrorPlot which alolows a line plot to 
  have error bars (+/- delta error).

* [me] Added Ticks::SetSize()

* [me] Modified size for plot mark circle so it will have the
  specified width as radius and not as diameter. 

* [me] Added Ticks::SetSize() to be able to set the absolute size 
  in pixels of the tick marks.

* [me] Default directories for Fonts and Cache now gets set
  automatically.


13-Jan 2003 JpGraph 1.10.1
==========================

* [me] Fix bug in Band pattern Left diagonal and Right Diagonal where
  the drawing was incorrect when width < height

* [me] Take the border on/off switch into account for line AddArea() 

* [me] Added color parameter to Axis::SetTickLabels() to make it
  possible to set individual colors on labels.

* [me] Fixed PiePlot::SetSliceColor() so that colors are now specified
  in the same order as slices.

* [me] Gantt, Radar and Canvas graph now also considers the special file
  _IMG_HANDLER (returns the actual image handler and doesn't stream
  picture back)

* [Christian Reiser] Pie graphs can now also return the IMG_HANDLER

* [Richard Black] Removed case sensitivity for extension of 
  background images. Added support for handling file names with
  multiple '.' characters in the path for background images.

* [me] Added error check for imagettfbbox() since it can give
  a file not found error even though both file_exists() and 
  is_readable() reports that the file exists and is readable
  in the case when PHP basedir restriction is in place.

* [me] Corrected CSIM handling in Gantt for non-file based
  Gantt charts.

* [me] Note to self: 1.10p

* [me] Gracefully handle the abnormal case where no valid data points
  is included in the Y-data array when creating a line plot.

16-Dec 2002 JpGraph 1.10
========================
* [me] Added GanttGraph::CreateSimple() whihc is a utility method to
  help create simple gantt charts with a minimum of code.

* [me] Added new plot (FieldPlot) type which handles field plots. This is
  basically a variant of scatter plots where each point is represented
  as an arrow which a specific direction (0-360 degrees).

* [me] Added Graph::SetY2OrderBack() to control of plots on Y2 should
  be under (in z-order) te plots on Y. By default they are on top.

* [me] Avoided a potential 1-pixel off rounding problem if a user 
  supplies a non integer canvas width and height in the Graph() call. 

* [me] Added two new formats for week scale in Gantt
  charts. WEEKSTYLE_FIRSTDAYWNBR, WEEKSTYLE_FIRSTDAY2WNBR These
  formats adds the weeknumber as well to displaying the date of the
  start of the week. Also tweaked the auto-sizing of the Gantt charts
  to adjust for the size of the text in the week scale.

* [me] Fixed wrong define in jpgraph_gantt.php for WEEKSTYLE_DAY2 
  (Bug #45) 

* [me] Improvements on manual scaling. If a manual scale is specifed
  (in the Graph::SetScale()) you are now longer required to specify a 
  major and minior tick interval (but of course you can still do it
  with a call to Ticks::Set() ). 
  A suitable intervall will be automatically
  caclulated in the same way as for autoscaling. By default the exact
  limits for the scale as specified will be used. This means that
  depending on the scale and tick intervall chosen the max value of
  the scale may or may not fall on a major tick mark. If you want that
  behaviour you need to call Scale::SetAutoTicks(). By using this call
  you give the algorithm permission to slightly adjust the specified 
  min and max values (if needed) so that they wil fall on a even 
  major step.

* [me] Added error check if user tries to use SetTextLabelStart() 
  with a logarithmic scale (where it is undefined).

* [me] Default marker for scatter plots are now a filled square

* [me] Adjusted the x-axis labelling for a 1-pixel off limit. Which 
  sometimes (depending on the image size and scale) could cause a 
  linear scale's last label not to be shown.

* [me] Fixed bug report #40

* [me] Fixed positioning of caption for full odometers. (Bug #34)

* [me] Fixed spelling mistake in jpgraph_odo.php which casued
  Odometer::SetLabelPos() to have no affect. (Bug #33)

* [me] Fixed an overzeoulous optimization which skipped both rotation
   and translation for angle=0. Addresses (Bug #36)

* [me] Colors can now include an alpha channel specification as well.
  The alpha channel is specified in the text string separated by a 
  a '@' , for example "red@0.5". The alphachannel is specified as a 
  fraction between 0.0 and 1.0.

* [me] Improved filled line plots so they now handle negative values
  in a more standard way.

* [me] Added automatic detection of what version of GD is installed.

* [me] Aligned the order of legends and slices for pie and 3D pies so
  that they now follow the more common order of clockwise slices with
  legends from top to bottom.

* [me] Changed call to deprecated function SetLinePos() to SetLineSide()

* [me] Added clipping to generated plots. This means that if you have
  plots (for example lines) which extends outside the scale range it
  will be clipped. This might come in handy in for example balloon
  plots. Clipping is enabled by default but can be controlled by a
  call to Graph::SetClipping()
  
* [me] Fixed a problem with circles and filled circles when they were
  rotated twice in a rotated graph. (Bugtraq #26)

* [me] Added Graph::Set90AndMargin() which helps for doing a 90
  degrees rotation and getting the margins right. (Otherwise you have
  to adjust them manually since height becomes width and width becomes
  height when you rotate 90 degrees)
  Changed the horizbar* examples to use the Set90AndMargin()

* [me] Changed the behaviour of plot marks in legends. The possible
  format callback is no longer called. Instead the plotmarks are
  set to a default size.

* [me] Added three more plotmarks MARK_LEFTTRIANGLE,
  MARK_RIGHTTRIANGLE, MARK_FLASH. These new types are primarily meant
  to be used with GanttCharts.

* [me] Added constrain lines to GanttCharts. It is now possible to
  illustrate start-end, start-start, end-start and end-end
  constrains. This is illustrated by adding lines with arrows, 
  Use GanttPlotObject::SetConstrain()

* [me] Added Image map support for Gantt chart. Bar and titles can now
  have associated image map targets. Use GanttBar::SetCSIMTarget()
  GanttBar::SetCSIMAlt() and for titles use
  GanttBar::title::SetCSIMTarget() and  GanttBar::title::SetCSIMAlt()

* [me] Fix problem in Gantt graph whereby the progress bar indicator
  could extend over the end date if an explicit date scale was set.

* [me] By default logarithmic scale now print the labels as 10^3
  instead of 1000. You can change the behaviour with the new
  method for logarithmic ticks, SetLabelLogType().
  Also added the possibility to have a callback for log scales

* NOTE TO SELF 1.9p

* [me] Added the possibility to specify a value > 1 as the position
  for labels in PieGraph::SetLabel() to increase the margin between
  the label and the edge of the pie.
 
* [Olaf Kandel] Fixed subtle bug in the printing of the month scale for the 
  case where the start and end month hjave the same number but 
  are on different year. This would cause the width for the
  first month to be wrong.


Jpgraph 1.9.1
=============
* [me] Fixed defects #20 and #21 (spelling mistake and and one
overzelous last minute error check I added). I have to eat a lot
of humble pie over these ones. Sorry to all who have been affected.
What can I say? Human error........

JpGraph 1.9
===========
* [me] Changed the way TTF fonts are handled. The font files are no
  longer distributed with JpGraph due to potential copyright problem.
  This change also has the advantage that it is now very 
  straigthforward to install new fonts whatever their naming 
  conventions are.

  1. If you are running on a standard Windows system just point the
  TTF directory to your standard font directory and use the available
  fonts in windows.

  2. If you are on a Unix system you can download the MS Core TTF
  files from http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/. The old MS EULA allows
  distribution of the fonts in unaltered form (Win EXE) and this
  project exercises this right and provide tools to download and
  install the fonts on a UNIX system.

* [me] Renamed this release from 1.8.1 to 1.9 due to the big
  change in the handling of TTF fonts which breaks backward
  compatibility due to the copyright problem with TTF fonts.

* [me] Improved the TTF pargagraph layout engine for consistency 
  in handling "\n\r" vs "\n". It is now always sufficient to 
  use just "\n".

* [me] Adjusted the text positioning for StrokeBoxedText()
  to use the new GetBBoxHeigh() and GetBBoxWidth().

* [me] Added  Image::GetBBoxHeight(), Image::getBBoxWidth()

* [me] Once and for all fixed the handling of rotated TTF text by
  adding Image::GetBBoxTTF() which returns the bounding rectangle
  (which is not the same as the bounding box except for angle==0)

* [me] Added argument to Legend::SetColor() to make it possible
  to specify both frame and font color.

* [me] Cosmetic adjustment of markers in legend so that they are 
  positioned exactly in the middle of the text string.

* [me] Corrected the positioning of TTF fonts when defining the 
  hotspot as 'bottom'. It could be up to 4 pixel off when using
  texts that contained character that extended below the TTF
  baseline e.g. '('.

* [me] Added possibility to use a cache system with CSIM images
  as well. The cache system is used slightly, slightly different
  and require a call to the new method Graph::CheckCSIMCache()
  This is unfortunately unavoidable due to the nature of CSIM in
  HTML. The documentation is updated to deal with this. This also
  added two more defines CSIMCACHE_DIR and CSIMCACHE_HTTP_DIR

* [me] Added CSIM (Client Side Image Maps) to legends, added
  target and alt arguments to all Plot::SetLegend()

* [me] Added functionlity to pass on any URL arguments when using
  StrokeCSIM() (Bug: #006)

* [me] Fixed so that Gantt charts can again have just the width
  specified and have the height automtically sized. (This was a 
  regression introduced in 1.8) (Bug #005)

* [me] Added error check for return value from imaagecolorsforindex()
  in Anti-aliased lines. In combination with GD2, no-true-color, a 
  true color background (ala JPG) this can fail since it gets a color
  which doesn't exist (since it uses imagecolorat()).

* [me] Improved edges support in 3D Pies.

* [me] Changed Image::Polygon() so i now draws an open polygon and not
  a closed one.

* [me] Legends for scatter plots no displays the mark used for
  each scatter plot and not just a square with the correct 
  color.

* [me] Fixed a small cosmetic problem in that horizontal legend
  box was sometimes not wide enough and made a small adjustment 
  of the positioning of marks in the legend box for better
  apperance. (Bug #0017)

* [me] Improved manual by adding linked TOC.

* [me] Added Bezier curve to canvas Shape class. Added Bezier canvas
  example canvasbezierex1.php

* [me] Added Paragraph Alignment setting in Text::Align() as well to
  avoid seprate call to Text::SetParagraphAlign()

* [me] Added Image::SetExpired() . By default the image now sends
  back a couple of variants of "no-cache" headers to force the browser
  to reload.

* [me] Some serious speed improvments for 3D Pie plots. It can now be
  up to 6000% faster (yes that's right 6000%!). This is the way I had
  planned on doing it but for time reasons were pushed out of 1.8.
  I have completely changed the algorithm that handles the individual 
  slices on the expense of a slightly more complicated implementation.
  This means that there is no performance difference between 2D and
  3D Pie Plots.

* [me] Fix bug for rotation of paragraphs (multi-line) texts. 
  A limitation for now is that rotated pargraphs always gets
  paragraphs align "left". (Bug: #008)

* NOTE TO SELF: 1.8p

* [me] Fixed a typo that had the strange affect that paragraph strings
  which started with a number would have larger distance between the
  individual lines since that number would be interpretated as the
  angle for the text!

* [me] Fixed a problem with marks getting out of sync if NULL values
  are present in the line plot. (Bug #0018)

* [me] Scatterplot no skips NULL values instead of treating them
  as zero.

* [me] Added LinearScale::SetAutoMax() as complement to SetAutoMin()

* [me] Added LinearScale::SetAutoTicks() this makes it possible to
  manually set a scale but still have the tick marks automatically
  determined. By default this feature is off to keep old code
  behave exactly the same as before. If this is enabled any 
  Ticks::Set() calls are ignored.

* [me] Added possibility to adjust the position of the displayed 
  value for bars via the BarPlot::SetValuePos() method. Added new
  example example20.5 to demonstrate this.

* [me] Bugfix: Fixed color themes for 3D pie plot. The color array 
  was not wrapped around in the case where more slices (data points) 
  than colors is used. (Bug: #001)

* [me] Documentation is now 100% pure HTML and does not require
  any PHP. Previously a PHP script was used to generate the 
  highlighted source used in the image/source frames. All this
  is now pre-generated in the docs.

* [me] Position the values in a scatter plot in the center of the 
  plot mark by default (Setting align to 'center','center' and margin=0

* [me] Added LinePlot::SetBarCenter to make it possible to center the
  line on the bars when combining a plot with both bars and lines.
  The new example 'ceneterdlinebarex1.php' demonstrates this.



[19-Sep-2002] JpGraph 1.8
=========================
* [me] Added Text::SetPos() as alias for Text::Pos() to harmonize with
  other setting methods.

* [me] Made Graph::Add() polymorphic. You can now use Graph::Add() to
  add all plot objects and you don't longer have to use AddText(),
  AddLine(), AddBand() and so on.

* [me] Added PiePlot::SetLabelPos(), added some more Pie examples.

* [me] Improved the API for class Text by adding SetShadow() to make
  it more like the other objects. Extended Text::SetBox() with shadow
  width and corner radius.

* [me] Added the possibility for Text object to use the new rounded
  rectangles as the filled background.

* [me] Added possibility to add arbitrary labels inside the pie plot

* [me] Added special filename __IMG_HANDLER to make it possible to
  have Graph::Stroke() return the image handler instead of stroking
  the image to file (or stream it back).

* [me] Improve FilledCircle() to avoid moire-patterns in circle.

* [me] Added middle type pie plot

* [me] User specified values for the band position is truncated to the
  min  and max values of the axis.

* [me] Added possibility to use Text::SetMargin() for all the titles
  in a graph

* [me] Added SetSize() as synonym for SetWidth() for plot marks.

* [me] Updated some of the examples with more comments.

* [me] Fixed problem with with jpg background images wrongly being
  loaded with imagecreatefromjpg instad of imagecreatefromjpeg

* [me] Corrected the positioning of individual titles for 3D
  plots.

* [me] Added Text::SetMargin() to make it easy to have context
  sensitive margins.

* [me] Added capability to have background images on Pie and 3D 
  Pie plots

* [me] Added method Axis::HideLine() which hides the axis line but
  nothing else.

* [me] Fixed bug in Stroke::Text() where negative coordinates 
  wasn't properly handled. We must allow negative absolute 
  coordinates since these might be rotated/translated into
  "real" screen coordinates. This fixes the bug, for example 
  in bar_csimex1.php where the first value of the bar wasn't
  displayed.

* [me] More adjustment of how the rounding takes place with
  coordinates. This should now avoid all potential difference
  between different graphic objects.

* [me] When you use automatic labelling on text scale it now starts
  at 1 and not at 0. This makes more sense since most people (except
  mathematicians) start counting from 1. 

* [me] Example directory: 
       - Added more advanced canvas examples
       - Updated all CSIM examples
       - ~60 new example script which are used in the new documentation

* [me] Compensate for bug in imagettfbox() which return to small size for
  large fonts. 

* [me] Added jpgraph_canvtools.php which contain some utility classes for
  use with canvas graphs.

* [me] DOCUMENTATION: The class reference is now included in the release.

* [me] DOCUMENTATION: Completely rewritten the original
  Word-introduction to JpGraph to pure HTML. This will be a living 
  document that will be updated  as time moves on. This is currently
  considered "Beta" and more chapters need to be added but this is
  a good start!! 

* [me] Added full support for multiline legends. (See for example 
  nullvalueex01.php. Also improved the way lineplot with marks
  are illustrated in the legend by adding the line underneth the
  plotmark.

* [me] Added some utility classes to be able to draw DB schema for
  DDDA. This is tailored for my DB abstraction layer (jpdb.php) 
  in DDDA but is generic enough to work in other circumstances as well. 
  The classes can be found in utils/misc/imgdbschema.inc 
  Please see (run) dbschema_ddda.php which shows how it looks 
  in a real life example.

* [me] Tweaked the positioning of TTF fonts and how the width and 
  height are determined. Making more carefull assumptions about
  how the baseline is handled for individual lines of text.

* [me] Added class RectangleText() which makes it easier to work
  with text inside a rectangle with rounded corner.

* [me] Added support for multi-line TTF paragraphs with paragraph
  formatting. This was previously only supported for the builtin
  fonts. All text object should now support fully formatted paragraphs
  of text.

* [me] Added Image::RoundedRectangle() and 
  Image::FilledRoundedRectangle()

* [me] Added format callback to plot marks. This makes it 
  possible to individually adjust the plot marks depending
  on it's specific data value. See balloonex1.php

* [me] Added some initial support for super script used for
  scientific numbering, i.e properly print for example 10^2
  where the 2 is in superscript. This is all handled by the
  new class SuperScriptText(). Not yet used in the actual 
  labels drawing but will be added shortly.

* [me] Added a small tool mkgrad.php in the utils directory to
  make it a breeze to create gradient squares which may be
  used as background images.

* [me] Added footer class to graph. This makes it easy to have
  left,center and right footers in your graphs.

* [me] Added subsubtitle to graphs

* [me] Improved/Changed the way you work with CSIM. This new method
  makes it possible to generate CSIM without having to create an
  intermediate image on disk.
  Added Graph::StrokeCSIM(). Added new chapter in the docs on how to
  work with CSIM

* [me] Changed naming of Spider* to Radar* since SpiderGraph is a 
  copyrighted name. 

* [me] Modified the automatic suppression of the first value of the
  X-axis when the Y-axis have negative value so it don't happen
  in the case where the X-axis is positioned at the minimum of 
  the Y-axis. 

* [me] Fixed spelling error of BK* instead of the correct BG*
  for the default settings of background image style.

* [me] Some internal code changes to RGB() class to make it easier
  to use directly for external scripts.

* [me] Changed the behaviour of filled line plot so that they
  don't go down to 0 for null values in the plot but instead
  behaves like '-' for non-filed plots, just ignore them and
  connect the previous and next point instead.

* [me] Fixed problem in integer scaling where it certain scale
  combinations could generate floating point labels! Ooops..
  (Affects IntCalcTicks()) 


[5-July-2002] JpGraph 1.7
==========================
* [me] Removed the APACHE_CACHE_DIRECTORY define since it is
  not used. 

* [me] Added Image map functionlity for rotated bar graphs,
  also added new example for this (bar_csimex3.php)

* [me] Made Ticks::SetPrecision() deprecated. Use SetFormatString() 
  instead

* [me] Fixed problem with incorrect string being returned from
  ToCyrillic()

* [me] Allow Y2 axis to use "int" scale

* [me] Fixed problem with wrongly names framework function for
  patterns

* [me] Fixed small problems with margins being slightly off for
  roated images.

* [me] Changed name of PlotMark::SetMarkColor() to PlotMark::SetColor()
  for consistency

* [me] Added example with "hidden" Y-axis.

[17-June-2002] JpGraph 1.7-BETA
===============================
* [me] Added DisplayValue::SetFormatCallback() to make it possible to use
  a user specified formatting callback routine. 
  (Note:: Yes, this is very nono-OO but the proper OO way, by forcing the 
  user to define a subclass of the plot class where the formatting method 
  is overridden will probably not fly with to many non-OO PHP peoples since 
  a callback is conceptually simpler.)

* [me] Added DisplayValue::HideZero(). Makes it possible to hide zero values
  in labels, for example zero slices in pie's, (e.g. $pieplot->value->HideZero())

* [me] Added manual scaling to Gantt graphs, added example to illustrate
  this, fixscale_gantt.php

* [me] Adding image maps for Y2 scale as well.

* [me] Fixed a small bug which made it impossible to use BRAND_TIMING with
  Gantt charts. Enabling timestamping of graphs would give a "PlotArea to small" 
  error.

* [me] Made a very small change to the AutoScaling algorithm to yield tighter
  boundaries, i.e with the existing algorithm, depending on rounding problems
  a plot which had a maximum value of, say 4, could get a autoscaling max
  value of 5. Not a big problem (or hardly a bug) but not what I wanted.
  All my 111 test cases works fine with the modification but I'm still 
  not convinced that this (very minor) adjustment is 100% (I can distinctly 
  remember that I had a good reason to do it the original way, I just can't 
  remember what :-)

* [me] Graph titles may now have multiple rows. By default the lines will
  be centered, but this may of course be adjusted by a call to, for 
  example, $graph->subtitle->ParagraphAlign('left');

* [me] Added class FuncGenerator() to make it easy to generate
  function plots (both normal and polar). To illustrate this I have 
  added three new examples funcex1.php,funcex2.php,funcex3.php. 

* [me] Added Axis::HideFirstLastLabel() to hide first and last label on
  axis. This is usefull if we have a box around the plot area and we don't
  want the labels to owerwrite the box (see funcex1.php)

* [me] Make sure GD2 variables is registred in $GLOABALS[]

* [me] Fixed bug in image maps for marks. Alt strings was incorrectly
  indexed so it was only using values 0,2,4.. instead of 0,1,2,...

* [me] Added Graph::SetAxisStyle(). This makes it easy to use 
  a few number of preset axis setup. For example duplicating the axis
  as a border around the plot. Preset axis position availabel are
  AXSTYLE_SIMPLE, AXSTYLE_BOXIN, AXSTYLE_BOXOUT

* [me] Made Axis::SetTickLabelMargin() deprecated. Use
  Axis::SetLabelMargin() instead. Name change to make it more
  consistent with the other margin settings.

* [me] Made Ticks::SetSide() a synonym for Ticks::SetDirection() 
  to make it consistent with side setting for labels and values.

* [me] Added Axis::HideZeroLabel() as a shortcut for 
  axis->scale->ticks->SupressZeroLabel()

* [me] Internal code changed. Replace the use of FontProp in SpiderGraph
  with Text() and some additoinal code cleanup.

* [me] Adjusted Image::Arc() so that no negative angles are
  passed on to GD imagearc() since it barfs at negative angles.

* [me] Added PiePlot3D::SetHeight() which is used to specify the
  height in pixels of the 3D pies instead of using the default
  height.
 
* [me] Pie plots (both 2D and 3D) now displays the slice labels
  by default.

* [me] Added two more Examples. barintex1.php shows how to use 
  integer scale and barscalecallbackex1.php shows how to use
  a callback function for formatting the scale.

* [me] Modified grace calculation for Integer scale to have higher
  sensitivity.

* [me] Restructured code so class DateLocale is now in jpgraph.php
  rather than in jpgraph_gantt.php. Also added $gDateLocale as a
  global instance of the class DateLocale

* [me] Modified integer autoscale to correctly handle very small values
  (needs special handling of max==1 to avoid fraction)

* [me] Changed the way min value is extracted when finding the baseline
  for bar plots. Now uses the function Scale::GetMinVal() instead of
  reading the value directly fomr the instance variable. This makes it
  work better with logscales so that the bar starts from the min value
  of the log scale. Also added check in bar PreStrokeAdjust() to see if
  we are using a log Y-scale to automatically adjust the Y-base.

* [me] Optimized Stroke() loop for LinePlot so calls to PlotMark::Stroke()
  will only be done if the marks are really to be shown.

* [me] Added Axis::SetLabelAlign(). 

* [me] Made some internal modifiaction on how Axis title gets aligned
  to make it possible to specify it manually without having it 
  automtically set. This makes it possible to generate nice
  horizontal bar graphs.
  
* [me] Added three examples in the Example directory on how to make
  horizontal bar graphs.
  
* [me] Don't always set Y-axis position automtically 

* [me] Add Text::SetAngle() as synonym for SetOrientation()
  Added SetLabelSide() as synonym for SetlabelPos()

* [me ]Make it possible to manually specify the alignment of the textstring 
  for the title position. This makes title looks nicer with horizontal
  bar graphs.

* [me] Allow Y-axis labels to be at an angle

[14-May-2002] JpGraph 1.6.3
===========================
Changes/Additions:
* [me] Added functionality to make AccBarPlot::SetAbsWidth() work in
  jpgraph_bar.phps

* [me] LinePlot::SetColor() no longer sets the color of the plotmark.
  The problem that some people had was that if you set the mark color
  specifically first and then unsuspecting called SetColor() for the
  line the color for the plotmark circumference would also be set making
  it look like the PlotMark::SetColor() didn't work.

* [me] Improved the functionality of GanntGraph::SetDateRange() to make
  it possible to display a section of the graph.
  (In previous version it was a checked error if you tried to plot 
  a graph where any activity bar was outside the specified area. 
  This is now changed to only cap the bars to the area. 
  This makes it more suitable to handle big gantt charts 
  which now can be split into several images to show different 
  parts of the projects)

* [me] Added GanttScale::SetWeekStart() to set the start of week to an
  arbitrary day. For example SetWeekStart(0) will make the weeks start
  on Sunday, SetWeekStart(1), Monday and so on.

* [me] Fixed a rounding error in Gantt chart that could cause the week
  start day to off by one.

* [me] Modified the Min() and Max() methods for AccLineBar's to avoid
  them overestimating the max value. (Basically now using the same
  methods as in AccBarPlot)

* [me] Added missing code to do percentage calculation for 3D Pies so
  they work the same way as the 2D Pies.

* [me] Added error check for the case where the image is so small that
  the available plot area becomes to small.

* [me] Compensate for a PHP bug (#12474) in strtotime() which can affect 
  Gantt chart so that the same month name is shown twice.
  See http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=12474
  
* [me] Compensate for the documented shortcomming in my
  3D Pie algortitm whereby a small exploded slice close to 270 degrees
  get's slighthly nagged at tha base due to the fact that the z-order
  stroking algorithm is only perfect if the slices are not exploded.


[20-April-2002] JpGraph 1.6.2
=============================
Changes/Additions:
* [me] Slightly adjusted LinearTicks::Stroke() to better handle som
  potential rounding problems.

* [Thomas George] Added LinePlot::AddArea() which makes it possible
  to just fill part of a line plot (a part that is specified with a 
  start and end x-point)

* [Thomas George] Fixed bug with missing coordinate when using filled
  line plot with step style.

* [me] Added client side image maps to scatter and line plots

* [me] Fixed problem with warning "IMG_ARC_CIRCLE not defined" when 
  running on GD 1.x
  
* [me] Removed test with is_null() in jpgraph.php to make JpGraph 1.6.2 
  work with older versions of PHP (especially 4.02).
  

[07-April-2002] JpGraph 1.6.1
=============================
Changes/Additions:
* [me] Modified autoscaling for the case where all values are equal to
  make the min/max difference larger.

* [me] Fixed bug in 3D pies for certain data values

* [me] Fixed bug with images maps assuming that slices 
  where order anti-clockwise and the new pie algorithm did them
  clockwise.

* [me] Added subtitle to Pie and Pie3D graphs.

[02-April-2002] JpGraph 1.6
===========================
Changes/Additions:
* [me] Changed license to QPL

* [me] Completely rewritten algorithm for 3D pies which gives MUCH better result. Will
  also allow exploded 3D pies.

* [D. Reinbach] Better handling of filling line plot with negative
  values

* [me] Added LinePlot::StrokeDataValue() for easy handling of plotting
  data point values.
* [Gyozo Papp,me] Real locales for Gantt chart. The locales now take a
  proper locale string (e.g. "en_UK", or "sv_SE") to get the real
  locales from the system. Note that this breaks the sc compatibility 

* [me] Removed jpgraph_dir.php and moved the directory settings back in
  jpgraph.php due to problems in PHP with nested includes and search
  paths.

* [me] Added possibility to show values for scatter plot by
  refactoring value support back into jpgraph.php Plot() class. This
  makes it easy for all subclasses that uses Plot() to add display
  value support.

* [me] Added possibility to use X-coordinates in Error plots

* [me] Fixed missing LogScale::SetXLabelOffset(). This made it
  impossible to use linear plots with a log x-scale !!!  

* [me] Fixed bug  so possible Y2 plots are also taken into account when auto
  scaling the X-axis. This could otherwise couse plots outside the
  scale when using Y and Y2 plots where Y2 plots had more data values.
  
* [me] **********!!SC BREAK!!**************
  Aligned the way values are displayed on Bar graphs with line and
  scatter plots. The values to be displayed for these plots are now
  all accessed through the "value" property of the plot. For example
  $myBarPlot->value->Show();
  instead of the previous
  $myBarPlot->ShowValue();

* [me] **********!!SC BREAK!!**************
  Aligned the way values are displayed in Pie plots with line and
  bar plots. You know use the "value" property in exactly the same way
  as in bars and lines. 

* [me] **********!!SC BREAK!!**************
  Aligned the way values are displayed in 3D Pie plots with line and
  bar plots. You know use the "value" property in exactly the same way
  as in bars and lines. 

* [me] Added possibility to display individual values in an
  accumulated bar graph in addition to the overall accumulated
  value. This is done as usual through setting the individual bars
  value property to what you want (size, color, format and so on)

* [me] Added another default error handler which is image based to
  make it easier to see error messages when images are included
  in a page. This is now the default error handler.

* [me] Added possibility to specify the location of the X-Axis
  to the top of the graph by using xaxis->SetPos("max") also
  added new Example topxaxisex1.php to demonstrate this feature.

* [me] Added more 3D pie examples to demonstrate new functionlity.

[01-March-2002] JpGraph 1.5.3
=============================
Changes/Additions:
* [me] Make it possible to use JpGraph 1.5.3 with GD 1.8.x. In 1.5.2 I was 
  using a function only available in GD 2.x.
 

[29-Feb-2002] JpGraph 1.5.2
===========================

Bug fixes:
----------
* [me] Released the correct 3D pie file (By mistake I mixed the stable version with
  the  development branch for 2.0 in the 1.5.1 release just to prove
  that I'm still human :-)

* [me] Fixed out of bounds error when using shadows for bar graphs
  with 0 value

* [me] Fixed typo in DisplayValue::SetFormat()

* [me] Fixed potential array out of bounds error in Plot::Min() and
  Plot::Max()

* [me] Fixed misplaced ')' in string construction in call to
  JpGraph error.

Changes/Additions:
------------------
* [me] Added possibility to use "auto" file name when stroking
  directly to a file.	 


* [me] Added tag 'title' to the image maps to make for better
  compatibility with Mozilla. 

* [me] Moved class LineProprty to jpgraph.php from jpgraph_gantt.php
  since it can be used in other modules as well.

* [me]Added Text::GetTextHeight() which differs from
  Text::GetFontHeight() in that it takes the total text height
  (possible multiple lines) into account.

* [me] Added Image::FilledArc()

* [me] Added RotImage::SetTranslation()
       Added RotImage::Circle()
       Added RotImage::FilledCircle()
       Added RotImage::Arc()
       Added RotImage::FilledArc()


[11-Feb-2002] JpGraph 1.5.1
===========================
* [me] No longer treat a not set $y[0] value as an explicit error. Instead
  silently set $y[0] to 0.

* [me] Changed "include" to "require" in jpgraph.php when including 
  jpgraph_dir.php. This seems to fix the strange problem whereby
  the constants defined in jpgraph_dir.php didn't have a correct
  value in jpgraph.php.

* [me] Fixed problem with correctly drawing of bars when all bars
  are negative. (Previously the baseline wasn't correctly handled
  since min/max values needs to be mirrored for negative bars)
  Note: Funny this problem has gone unnoticed so long.

* [me] Fixed problem with doing gradient fill for negative bars.

* [me] Fixed problem with autoscaling when there is a very small
  difference (< 0.00001) between min and max and when both min and max are
  negative. This might happen if you have a single negative value.

* [me] Added labels for line graph. Each point my now also optionally
  display it's value on a line graph. Value are controlled trough
  class DisplayValue and it's instance in LinePlot.
  LinePlot->value->Show(), 
  LinePlot->value->SetColor(),	
  LinePlot->value->SetFont(), 
  LinePlot->value->SetMargin(),
  LinePlot->value->SetFormat(),
 
 
[27-Jan-2002] JpGraph 1.5
=========================
* [me] Fixed misnamed xmin variable in Min() for acc bars

* [me] Added possibility to specify paragraph alignment for
  multi line text, i.e the text can be left,right or center aligned
  within it's bounded box. The lignment is set by the new method
  Text::ParagraphAlign()

* [me] Changed position specification for text so that if the position 
  is specified in range [0,1] it is interpreted as fraction of image
  height width and otherwise as absolute pixels.

* [me] Added possibility to specify pie size (radius) both as a fraction and
  absolute size in pixels.

* [me] Added possibility to tweak color specification by adding a 
  saturation percentage, i.e you can specify color as "red:0.65"
  which means 65% of the red value (in other words 35% darker).

* [me] Tweaked the estimation of number of segments to approximate an 
  arc in Image::CakeSlice.

[17-Jan-2002] JpGraph 1.5beta2a
===============================
* [me] Fixed typo in Max() calculation for accumulated bar graphs 
  which caused it to return wrong value.

* [me] For Min() calculation for acc bars graphs take the user
  specified ymin into account.

* [Peter Svistunov, me] Added Cyrillic unicode support through the
  global define LANGUAGE_CYRILLIC. This is also the start of a 
  generic support for Unicode languages through the LanguageConv
  class.


[15-Jan-2002] JpGraph 1.5beta2
==============================
* [me] Rewrite of the pie-chart drawing algorithm. This version
  is slightly slower but avoids using GD floodfill function. This
  fixes problems with small slices not being filled completely. As
  an added bonus it is now possible to explode (and specify the
  explode radius) for all slices. It is also possible to draw the
  pie without having internal borders between the slices as well
  as turning on/off the border surronding the pie.

* [me] Added graphic primitive CakeSlice() to the Image class.
  Used to simplify pie-drawing.

* [me] Added more generic error handling. It is now possible to
  install your own error object with 
  JpGraphError::Install(<name of error object>)
  The default error handler will just abort execution. 

* [me] Security whole in utility script for displaying source
  and image in frames fixed.

* [Cedric Scheyder] Actively ignore hours in calculating Max/Min
  values for dates in Gantt charts to avoid problems in autoscaling
  when users specify start and end dates down to hours.

* [Rick Widmer] Fixed problem in calculating min/max value when first 
  Y-value was non-numeric.
  
* [me] Fixed calculation of width and height of text with multiple lines.
  Multiple text lines (text blocks) should now be almost fully supported.


[16-Dec-2001] JpGraph 1.5-BETA
==============================
* Take "\n" into (some) account when calculating string height and width
  Text output now supports multiple lines better.

* [me] Removed reference to global PHP_SELF, use HTTP_SERVER_VARS array
  instead. This makes JpGraph working with 'register_globals' turned
  off.

* [me] Added some rudimentary check that GD is enabled before trying to
  run JpGraph.

* [me] Fixed silly cut-and-paste bug in AccBarPlot::Max() which could 
  cause to small max values to be returned

* [me] Added property 'title' to PlotMark. The title is printed in the center
  of the plotmark.

* [DanNY (dulcis28@hotmail.com)] Added JpGraph Logo. (Thanks!)

* [me] Added jplintphp.php, jpgendoc.php, jplintdriver.php which are
  parsing, documentation and pretty printing tools I use to help
  me to documentation and find unused code.
  Tthat does some simple static analysis on PHP for silly mistakes
  that I do (Like using instance variables without qualifying them 
  with "$this->" ) The tool also warns about unused instance variables.
  Since it also parses the classes and methods I use it to generate
  the documentation skeleton for the reference section.

* [me] Added Gantt chart funcionality, jpgraph_gantt.php . See
  Gantt tutorial for help on usage.

* [me] Added new Gantt tutorial

* [me] Added BKIMG_CENTER, possibility to center the background image.

* [me] Timeout function now also aplies when you generate an image
  off-line, i.e if the imagefile exist and is within the time window
  now file will be written.
  
* [Rasmus Lerdorf] Added patch to make background images work with GD 2.x
  N.B GD 2.01 has bugs in handling TTF font with truecolor images which
  are fixed in 2.02 but that has (of this writing) still not been officially
  released. GD 2.x support in JpGraph is still to be considered experimental.

* [me] Fixed some potential rounding errors in 2D Pie plot which in some
  circumstances might have caused a flood fill to escape. Also added check
  to better handle very small slices so we don't try to do a fill
  on the border edge.

* [me] Slightly changed the internal design for band patterns. 
  They are now created by a factory class instead. This makes it much easier 
  to re-use and have maximum code reuse.

* [me] Factored out some functionlity from Graph::Stroke() to make it possible
  to re-use some code in GanttGraph::Stroke()

* [me] One more instance when PHP surprised me by thinking 0 == "-" aarrghhh
  Now I think (knock on wood) all problems with data points=0 should be solved

* [me] Added '&' to the assignment in Graph::Add() This now lets you specify changes
  for lines, plots even after they been added to a Graph.  But I'm not sure if this
  is really such a good ide because you will have problem if you write code
  like
  
  	for( .... ) {
  		$myplot = new LinePlot(.....);
  		$graph->Add($myplot);
  	}
  	
  	Since this will not work the way you think (why?) Because the same
  	reference to the variable $myplot will be used for all additions and
  	hence the graph will only have multiple instances of the last added 
  	LinePlot(). Have to think of this and what is the best way. (I will 
  	probably never get used to PHP references....)


[11-Nov-2001] JpGraph 1.4
==========================
Bug Fixes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [me] Enabled E_NOTICE warnings in my PHP installation and found a couple of 
  glitches (harmeless out-of-bound in two loops) which is now corrected. 
* [me] Fixed problem in line plots where y-value==0 wasn't drawn. (Once again 
  bitten by the fact that in PHP the following is true: ""==0)
* [me] Fixed color specification for bars when initialized as an array of colors
* [me] Fixed color of bars using shadow which was advertedly set to shadow color
* [me] Fixing incorrect color specification for legends using bars with color arrays
* [me] Add check for sum=0 in pie plots to avoid divide by 0 problem
* [me] Changed the stroke orderd for FilledRectangle() so that the shadow doesn't
  overwrite a line with weight > 1
* [me] Fixed incorrect calculation of font height for titles which cause the 
       subtitle to be to close to the title.

Additions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [me] Added depth parameter (DEPTH_FRONT, DEPTH_BACK) for gridlines
       Graph::SetGridDepth()

* [me] Added possibility to add static horizontal and vertical band with a 
       pattern in the plot area. Graph::AddBand() Supports solid, diagonal,
       stright line, 3D-plane crosses (both diagonal/vertical) patterns.
       Graph::AddBand()
       
* [me] Added possibility to have static lines in the plot. This is now implemented
       with new class PlotLine and two new functions Graph::AddLine(), 
       
* [me] Added symbolic constants to specify background image types
       BGIMG_COPY, BGIMG_FILLPLOT, BGIMG_FILLFRAME

* [me] Added extended label formatting through either
   	Axis::SetLabelFormatString()		C-style formatting string
   	or
   	Axis::SetLabelFormatCallback()	A callback function that are given the value to be displayed
   												and should manipulate the value as it likes
   												
 		The use of the old style digit precision variable will be deprecated from next version.

* [me] Added error check if supplied Y-data has unspecified value at index 0 to avoid
  out of bounds error when corrupted data is sent in to JpGraph.
  
* [me] Added possibility to specify image depth for gridlines. You can now specify
  Graph::SetGridDepth() as DEPTH_FRONT or DEPTH_BACK. Depending on if you want
  the gridlines at the back of in front of your plots.

* [me] Added possibility to specify Cache file name as "auto". In this case the
  image file name will have the same name as the scriupt that generates the 
  image with the extension of the automtically generated graphic format.
  NOTE: You will get the wrong extension using this feature at the same
  time as specifying a different graphic format thne the automatically choosen 
  one.

* [me] Added some more advanced examples for impuls drawings impulsex3.php and 
  impulsex4.php

* [me] The values on top of bars can now be at an angle and the horisontal
  position now account for if a shadow is present.
  
* [me] Added filename to Graph::Stroke() which makes it easy to output an image
       directly to a file _without_ streaming it back to the browser. Usefull for
       batch processing
       
* [me] Added new tutorial for bar graphs

* [me] New scale type "int". This gives a normal linear scale but restricts
  ticks (and labels) to integer values. Can be used for both X and Y scales.

* [me] Added subtitle to graph

* [me] Added possibility to specify an array of X-coordinates with bar plots to 
  position individual bars on the X-scale. Makes it much easier to combine
  bar plots with other types of plots, (line, scatter etc)
  
* [me] Extended utility adjimage.php to allow it to manipulate color saturation.

* [me] Added Image::AdjSat() to allow manipulation of the color
  saturation in the image. This also makes it very easy to change the image
  to greyscale (just set saturation=-1). 
  Extended Graph::AdjImage() and Graph::AdjBackgroundImage() 
  to include new parameter for saturation value.
  
* [me] Added BarPlot::SetAlign() which makes it possible to align
  bars relative the tickmark for linear and int scale
  
* [me] Added possibility to absolutely set the width of bars. This will 
  override the automatically decided with based on the scale and tick distance
  
Changes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [me] Legend color for scatter plots now becomes the fill color of the mark

* [me] Impulsplots now anchors at Y-value = 0 if the y-axis contains both negative
  and positive values. Otherwise it will go to the lowest value on the Y-axis.

* [me] Bar shadows is now connected to bars to make for a stronger 3D effect.

* [me] Removed all deprecated references and usage of FONT0, FONT1, FONT2. Note
  You can no longer use these. Instead use FF_FONT0, FF_FONT1, FF_FONT2 etc
  
* [me] Text scale now starts default labelling at 0

* [me] All plots internally adjusted to start at default X-coordinate 0 to harmonize better 
  with X-scale.

* [me] Graph->Stroke() now just returns instead of exit()

* [me] Removed flag argument for BarPlot::SetShadow()

* [me] Bar plots are know by default filled with lightblue
  unless otherwise specified.
  
* [me] Changed the way bars are positioned for linear and integer
  scale for maximum flexibility when mixing barplot with other
  plots.
  
* [me] The ALT strings for all image maps now uses printf() syntax to display
  the actual value. If you have used this feature you must update your
  ALT strings, for example "val=%v" must become "val=%d" or whatever format 
  you choose. 
  
* [me] Changed the formatting of bar graphs by changing the framework
  so that labels on the x-axis using a text scale is now independent 
  on the tick marks. 
  This makes it possible to have the labels centered under each bar but have 
  the tickmarks between the bars as most other commercial graph packages
  format these typw of graphs. Introduced Axis::SetTextLabelsInterval()
  Effects jpgraph.php, jpgraph_log.php and jpgraph_bar.php
  
* [me] Renamed Axis::SetTextTicks() to Axis::SetTextTicksInterval() to make the name
  more descriptive. The old name is deprecated from this version on but will still
  work until 2.0 to keep compatibility.
  
* [me] Cleaned up implementation of pie3d so it now inherits from pie to avoid
  a lot of duplicated code and easier maintainance.  (A good example of the real
  life OO programming where you might not see the similarities between two classes
  until you fully implement them.) File size of jpgraph_pie3d.php has shrunk by 
  roughly 40%
  
[23-Sep-2001] JpGraph 1.3.1
===========================
Additions:
* [Michael Anthon] Added client side image maps to 3D pie plots
* [me] Added possibility to better control the labeling of pie graphs with an optional
  label formatting string PiePlot::SetLabelFormat(), PiePlot::SetLabelType()
  This also makes it possible to have labels with the absolute value and not only the
  percentage. (same with pie3d)
* [me] Added formatting capabilities for legends on pie and pie3d graphs. Can have the value
  automtically included (Se Examples/pieex6.php)
* [me] Added some more examples, negbarvalueex1.php, scatterlinkex2.php, pie3d_csimex1.php
  pieex6.php
  

Known bugs and omissions:
- Client side image maps does not currently handle exploded pie graphs (just
  normal pie graphs.

Bug fixes:
* [me] Fixed problem with positioning the displayed values for negative bars
* [me] Fixed shadow for negative bars
* [me] Fixed problem in Plot::Min(), PlotMax::Max() whereby zeros where not counted 
  towards minimum since in PHP 0=="". This could sometimes cause strange autoscaling. 
* [Vitaly E. Ashmarin] Wrong arguments to imagejpeg() for combination of specified 
  image quality and filename = ""
* [John Milne] BarPlot::SetFillColor() fixed glitch in loop variable


[13-Sep-2001] JpGraph 1.3
=========================
Note: I have to the best of my memory tried to give credit where 
credit is due. Howevever, since ver 1.2.2 I have received over 2000 mail about
JpGraph with Questions/Suggestions/Improvments (and a few bug fixes) etc and 
I might have missed some in the process of going through these mails. The
fault is completely my own and if you recognize some idea I have implemented
something which you think you should have credit for please drop me a note and 
I will adjust the add you to the change notes.

Known bugs and omissions:
- The automatic value on bar graphs does not work well with
  negative bar graphs. (Quite easy to fix though..)
- Client side image maps does not currently handle exploded pie graphs (just
  normal pie graphs.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
* SC (SOURCE COMPATIBILITY) BREAK !: If you want to rotate the image the parameter
  is no longer supplied directly in the call to Graph() but rather as a method
  call Graph::SetAngle(). I decided to make this SC break since I judged it more
  natural to supply the timeout value just efter the specified cache-file name
  in the Graph() call. Hopefully this will not hit to many people since my hunch is
  that few people uses the rotate function and it's very easy to fix those script
  that does so.

Bug Fixes:
* [michael@anthon.net] Corrected behviour of accumulated bar graph so it now
  diffrentiate between the accumulated positive and negative values.
  
* [marko@fly.srk.fer.hr] Fixed Max() calculations for accumulated bar graphs
  where my original code was a little bit sloppy. (I simply took the max for
  each plot and added those and this might be more then the real maximum.)
  
* [m.purgar@extracom.de] Spotting an incorrect "jpg" in the image where it should
  have been "jpeg"
  
* [adam.blomberg@euroseek.net,patrik.johansson@euroseek.net] 3D-Pie filling 
  problem for small slices due to the discrapency between GD arc() and the 
  JpGraphs purely mathematical definition of an ellipse.
  
* [delorme.maxime@free.fr] 2D-Pie Floodfill might "escape" for very small values of slices.

* [et.al] Improved handling of 0:s vs "" values. This was necessary since PHP treats
  0 as "" the same in a number of situations and JpGraph needs to diffrentiate these
  two cases. This caused 0 data values to be treated as null values and not be inluded 
  in (for example) autoscaling consideration.

Additions:
* [me] Added new global constant USE_CACHE which makes it possible to disable
  writing to the cache even if a filename is supplied in th Graph::Graph() method.

* [me] Added LinePlot::SetStyle() to make it possible to make dashed, dotted etc
  lineplots. (See example1.2). Also adjusted legend to display the same style in
  the legend.
  
* [michael@anthon.net, me] Added client side image maps for all types of bars
  and 2D pies with possibility to have the actual value shown in an ALT-tag.
  
* [me] Added drop shadow (or rather "right-up" shadow) to bar graphs BarPlot::SetShadow()

* [me] Added possibility to have the actual value of bar graphs displayed at top of graphs
  via BarPlot::ShowValue(), BarPlot::SetValueFont(), SetValueMargin(), SetValueColor()
  The format of the value is specified according to standard C printf() string formatting
  i.e. "val=%d" will for example print a string "val=13" 
  
* [me] Added possibility to adjust brightness and contrast for background image
  via the Graph::AdjBackgroundImage() method.
  
* [me] Added possibility to adjust brightness and contrast in the finished image
  via the Image::AdjBrightContrast() method.
  
* [me] Added possibility to just generate an image to a file and not stream
  it directly back to the browser. Added parameter $aInline to Graph::Graph()
  
* [me] Added timout for cache, i.e if the image in the cache is older then 
  the specified number of minutes (=0 never re-generate, -1 always regenerate) 
  then re-generate the image. Just specify a timeout in minutes with a call:
  $mygraph->cache->SetTimeOut(10)
  
* [me] Added possibility to use logarithmic scale for SpiderPlots. This also resulted
  in a little bit of internal cleanup in jpgraph_spider.php.
  
* [me] Added SetWeight() method to class Ticks() for control of line thickness for ticks

* [me] Added SetMarkColor method to class TIcks() which lets you specify different
  colors for major and minor tick marks.
  
* [me] Added method RelTranslate() to LinearScale() and LogScale() classes which is used
  in Spider class. This makes a world to screen relative translation.
  
* [me] Added possibility to link data points in a scatter plot with lines
  by the addition of method ScatterPlot::SetLinkPoints()
  
* [me,john.milne@one2one.co.uk] Added possibility to have individual colors of
  bars in bar graphs by having BarPlot::SetColor() accept an array as argument.
  
* [sergio@alsernet.es] Make it possibly to have x-tick labels to consist of two lines
  by inserting a "\n" separator in the text.
  
* [CK1@wwwtech.de] Adding JPEG quality setting. This is done by adding 
  a method SetQuality() to the img class. After creating a graph this can then
  be used as $mygraph->img->SetQuality($some_qvalue).
  Currently this only affects JPEG images.
  
* [delorme.maxime@free.fr] Possibility to use different grace value for top and bottom
  of graph and not just a single value as in 1.2.2

Changes:
* [me] Changed group/permission handling for created files to better adjust itself
  to the way the local Apache user is setup
  
* [me] The default for spider graphs is now NOT to be filled

* [me] Allow all datapoints to be 0 which will set the scale to [0,1]

* [me] Removed the need for a DIR_BASE variable

  
[29-Apr-2001] JpGraph 1.2.2
===========================
Bug fixes:
* Removed reference to non-existent property 'bypass' in class RotImg
* Changed to allow the last X-gridline to be drawn (comparison with limit was '<'
  where it should have been '<=' )

Additions:
* Added possibility to use background image
* Added possibility to use approximate color through the "USE_APPROX_COLORS"
  constant
* Handling of diffrent form of "null values" for line graphs. An y-value
  can now be "" or "-". In the first case (a true null value) this mark
  will cause a disruption in the line graph to indicate that the value
  is undefined. In the other case specifying the value as "-" will cause
  the value to be ignored bu the line will still be drawn between the
  previous data point and the following. Neither of these cases will have
  any mark drawn.
* Added a fatal warning when no more colors can be allocated for the chosen 
  graphic format.

Changes:
* "Downgraded" anti-aliasing algorithm to use fewer color levels
  in the transition to avoid using up to much of the color palette
* Cleaned up some of the code to not rely on PHP default initialization
  of variables. This will help those who have got warnings when they
  have had all error reporting enabled in php.ini (E_ALL)
* Legends now show the plot mark (if defined) instead of just a square of
  the right color.

Acknowledgements:
* Thanks to kevin@pricetrak.com  for suggesting the treatment of 
  pure NULL values.
* Thanks to luca_n@hotmail.com for getting my attention to the warnings
  caused by relying on PHP default initialization of variables.  
  (My installation had E_NOTICE disabled, hence I never got those warning myself.)


[29-Mar-2001] JpGraph 1.2.1
===========================
Bug fixes:
* When min and max values for autoscaling was equal this resulted in trying to calculate
  log10(0) = INF resulting in an infinite loop in LinearTicks::Stroke()
* When autoscaling was used with only one data point it tried to calculate log10(0) = INF
  resulting in an infinite loop
* fopen("xxx","r") should be fopen("xxx","rb") causes problems on windows system with IIS5
* JPG streaming function was incorrectly called "imagejpg" should be "imagejpeg" (see the difference?)
* Non existent color name in jpgraph_pie.php
* Removed all deprecated forced references in function calls
* The width of the surrunding box was not calculated correctly for internal bold font

Additions:
* Color themes for pie graphs
* Beta release of 3D pie graphs
* Added DIR_BASE as constant to make it possible to use one system wide copy
of JpGraph. NOTE: This must be set to the directory where JpGraph is installed.

Acknowledgements:
* (ck1@wwwtech.de) (and a russian guy which I unfortunately lost the name of) 
  for reporting the imagejpg spelling mistake
* (ales.gregor@zps.skoda-auto.cz) for finding the binary file problem with IIS
* Several people have reported the problem with autoscaling when all Y-values 
  were equal. Thanks to you all for acting as my privet QA team!


[18-Mar-2001] JpGraph 1.2
=========================
Additions:
----------
* Added "BRAND_TIMING" which give possibility to brand each image generated with
the time (in ms) it took to generate the image.
* Added Gradient Fill for bar graphs, The gradient fill allows 6 different styles.
* Added Anti-aliasing for lines. Note drawing anti-aliased lines is 7-10 times 
slower then "normal" lines!
* Added full TTF support. this means an internal SC break (Source Code Break). Normal JpGraph
script should not be affected if you have used only publized "public" frunctions. The SC break is
to allow uniform treatment of both internal fonts and TTF. This has been achieved by changing
the parameter list for SetFont(). However, backward compatibility with the old naming conventions
for internal fonts are kepot, e.g. SetFont(FONT1_BOLD) still works but is deprecated and will not
be valid from 2.0 
* Added possibility to control font for title of Spider Axis through the added
property 'title' to the axis in the spider graph.
* Added 'SetColor()' in pie graphs as a shortcut to SetMarginColor() to set the background color
* Added possibility to draw X-axis labels at arbitrary angle. Internal fonts only supports
horizontal and verical.
* Added possibility to draw boxed text at an angle
* Added possibility to have different colors for axis and the labels on the axis by the addition 
of extra parameter to SetColor()
* Added 350 more named colors.
* Added canvas "fake" graph to make it easy to draw arbitrary graphics
* Added SetCenter() method for line graphs.
* Added SetGrace() for autoscaling purposes.

Changes:
--------
* If you use a text-scale for X-axis the default labels now start at 1 instead of 0 since this is 
actually a counting scale and it makes more sense to start at 1.
* Improved handling of bar-graphs with negative values.
* Updated existing examples to use new format for SetFont()
* Made it a critical error to specify a non existant font
* Changed so that orientation for Text() is now given as an angle, i.e. SetOrientation(45). Old
style of using SetOrientation("v") (for vertical) is deprecated. But will work until V2

Bug fixes:
----------
* Improved handling of computational effects on small values in scaling where a rounding error might cause the
last label not to be drawn.
* The position for the title of X-axis could in some cases be slightly different in first
and second pass due to incorrectly determination of the X-axis labels font height.
* Specifying an minimum Y-value for Y-axis on bar graphs could on rare occasions (combination 
of scale values and specified density of autoscaling ticks) cause a gap between the bottom of 
each bar and the X-axis.


[18-Feb-2001] JpGraph 1.1
=========================
Additions/Changes:
------------------
* Added Spider graphs 
* Added Pie graph
* Added Scatter (and impuls) graphs
* Added possibility to rotate plots an arbitrary angle
* Added step style rendering to lineplot
* Added Breseham circle drawing which gives better visual apperance
  then the built in Arc() in GD (on the expense of CPU and performance)
* Improved Polygon and Rectangle drawing so that it will use line weight settings
* Improved the visual appearance of lines with weight>1 by correctly calculating 
  (angle wise) the endpoints and using a filled polygon to draw the line. 
  Unfortunately it would require some real improvements in the GD library to really improve
  the visual appeance of lines with weight>1. This is as good as it gets without writing
  a low level pixe-by-pixel correct plotting. With my method you get it to look visually
  aestethic right in 90% of the cases with just 10% work. 
* Added MARK_FILLEDCIRCLE as new mark type. Note that due too the poor performance of the
  basic Arc() image primitive in PHP4 the circles isn't perfect circles, they tend to be a
  a little bit flat at multiples on PI/2.
* Added the possibility to have a separate fill- and line- color for marks
* Moved Class PlotMark from jpgraph_line.php to base in jpgraph.php since this class is also used
  with scatter plots. 
* Made it a critical error to try to use Text X-scale with specified X-data points. 
  Previously no warning was given for this non-defined state. (Using text scale with specified
  points really doesn't make sense.)
* Made it a critical error to use unknown color rather than silently replacing it with black.
* Updated documentation to reflect added capability


Bug fixes:
----------
* Fixed minor bug in Line() in which it didn't update the last point for use with
  subsequent LineTo() calls (forgotten $this->) 
* Eliminated assumptions in DashedLine() that x1<=x2 and y1<=y2 eliminates the 
  potential pixel overshoot.  
* Fixed a serious bug in Line plot when used with a specified X-scale (not the normal default)
  since the X-coordinate wasn't read from the correct vector!
* Fixed a serious bug whe using as specified X-scale since the maximum value for a plot 
  wasn't correctly passed to the autoscaling. 
  Note: The reason that these two bugs haven't been discovered previously is the fact 
  that my test specs didn't include test cases to do with specified X-axis (I almost never ever use that). 
  This has now been corrected and added to the test suit. 
* Fixed so the possible box around the plot area correctly honours the weight specified for it.


[05-Feb-2001] JpGraph 1.0
=========================
* Initial release.
