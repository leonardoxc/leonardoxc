2006-12-19  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r479] make-release.sh: Fixed svn copy.

2006-12-18  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r478] INSTALL, NEWS, README: Last-minute changes and
	  spell-checking... Oh, and $(date -u) tells me that today is
	  December 18th and not 19th as I though, so I will now delay the
	  release five minutes until we pass midnight UTC... :-)

	* [r477] make-release.sh: Fixed SVN URLs to the repository, fixed
	  locale to C to make sure that date doesn't try to be clever and
	  translates its output.

	* [r476] ., NEWS, make-release.sh: Let us try this as 0.9.1.
	  
	  There has been a lot of changes since version 0.9, but I would
	  still like to hold off on the 1.0 release until I feel that I
	  can support it properly with more frequent releases than what
	  we've seen until now (the rewritten make-release.sh script might
	  help with that).

	* [r475] README: Just a small note about the SVN code: people
	  should always try it out before submitting bug reports.

2006-12-13  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r474] README: Added an overview of the documentation.

2006-11-23  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r473] PelJpeg.php: A tiny bit of debug tracing...

2006-11-19  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r472] PelTag.php, po/da.po: Better title: 'JPEGProc' -> 'JPEG
	  Process'. Added a couple of new translations and removed
	  obsolete ones from the Danish translation.

	* [r471] po/da.po, po/de.po, po/es.po, po/fr.po, po/ja.po,
	  po/pel.pot, po/pl.po: Updated locales after deleting
	  PelTag::getDescription().

	* [r470] NEWS, PelTag.php: Removed the getDescriptions() method
	  since I don't see any good use of it as long as the strings it
	  return are taken directly from the Exif specification. If
	  someone can come up with good (smaller!) descriptions for the
	  tags, then we can add it back.

2006-11-18  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r463] INSTALL, NEWS, Pel.php, tutorials/PEL/using.pkg: Getting
	  rid of loadFile(), noted latest changes in NEWS.

	* [r462] test/image-tests/canon-ixus-ii.php,
	  test/image-tests/canon-powershot-s60.php,
	  test/image-tests/leica-d-lux.php,
	  test/image-tests/nikon-coolscan-iv.php,
	  test/image-tests/nikon-e5000.php,
	  test/image-tests/nikon-e950.php, test/image-tests/no-exif.php,
	  test/image-tests/olympus-c5050z.php,
	  test/image-tests/olympus-c50z.php,
	  test/image-tests/olympus-c765uz.php,
	  test/image-tests/pentax-istDS.php,
	  test/image-tests/sony-dsc-v1.php: Regenerated test cases.

	* [r461] test/image-tests/read-write.php: Update to new PelJpeg
	  constructor too.

	* [r460] test/image-tests/make-image-test.php: Updated to use the
	  new fancy constructor of PelJpeg.

	* [r459] examples/resize.php: An example of how to resize an image
	  while keeping the Exif data intact. This was inspired by the
	  code from Dave on the PEL Devel list.

	* [r458] PelJpeg.php, PelTiff.php: A more convenient interface for
	  creating new PelJpeg and PelTiff objects: simply pass a filename
	  or an image resource.

2006-11-04  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r450] AUTHORS: Credit David Lesieur for the French translation.

	* [r449] NEWS: News about the improved PelEntryTime and the
	  translation updates.

	* [r448] po/da.po: Tiny update of the Danish translation.

	* [r447] po/da.po, po/de.po, po/es.po, po/fr.po, po/ja.po,
	  po/pel.pot, po/pl.po: Updated pel.pot and all .po files with new
	  strings and correct line numbers.

	* [r446] po/fr.po: Updated French translation from David Lesieur.
	  Thanks!

2006-09-17  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r445] test/image-tests/olympus-c5050z.php,
	  test/image-tests/olympus-c50z.php: Updated with correct
	  timestamps.

	* [r444] test/ascii.php: New test cases for the Julian Day Count
	  magic.

	* [r443] PelEntryAscii.php, PelIfd.php: Changed PelEntryTime to
	  use a Julian Day Count internally instead of the more limited
	  UNIX timestamp. This enables use of the full range of Exif
	  timestamps, all the way from 0000:01:01 to 9999:12:31. The
	  setValue() and getValue() methods still default to UNIX
	  timestamps.
	  
	  Actually using dates in year 0 is pushing things a bit too far.
	  This is simply because there is no such thing as year 0: the
	  first year was year 1 and the year before that was year -1. But
	  apart from that all dates from year 1 to year 9999 should work.
	  
	  Also note, that by a lucky coincidence the illegal date
	  '0000:00:00 00:00:00' is mapped to 0 which is mapped back to the
	  string again. Many cameras store that string when the date is
	  unknown.
	  
	  There might be some trouble with time zones... please let me
	  know if you spot any problems.

	* [r442] PelEntry.php: Suppress the PrintIM tags too, they contain
	  binary stuff.

2006-09-07  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r441] NEWS: Reworded slightly.

	* [r440] make-release.sh: Updated to work with SVN instead of CVS.

	* [r439] authors.xml, users: New mapping file for use with svn2cl.

2006-09-06  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r438] run-phpdoc.sh: New path to phpDocumentor... it now
	  apparently /requires/ the base directory of it's installation to
	  be named PhpDocumentor, bumpy-cased and all?!

	* [r437] tutorials/PEL/PEL.pkg, tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg,
	  tutorials/PEL/using.pkg: Removed the ugly <!-- /// --> kludge to
	  prevent line breaks in places where phpDocumentor couldn't parse
	  them. The solution was to have Emacs avoid the line breaks using
	  this code:
	  
	  (defun mg-phpdocumentor-no-break () "Is point directly after a
	  phpDocumentor construction which cannot be broken?"
	  (looking-back "{@\\(link\\|tutorial\\) ")) (add-to-list
	  'fill-nobreak-predicate 'mg-phpdocumentor-no-break)

	* [r436] PelJpeg.php: Made getExif() return null in case there
	  were no Exif data.

	* [r435] README: Correct spelling.

	* [r434] README: Added a piece about trying the SVN version before
	  reporting bugs.

2006-09-05  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r433] NEWS: Documented latest changes.

	* [r432] PelJpeg.php, PelJpegMarker.php, examples/dirsort.php,
	  examples/rename.php, test/image-tests/make-image-test.php,
	  test/image-tests/read-write.php: Promote the use of the
	  PelJpeg::getExif() method.

	* [r431] INSTALL, test/README, test/run-tests.php, test/test.php:
	  Renamed test.php to run-tests.php.

	* [r430] test/test.php: Implemented a simple search function for
	  the SimpleTest installation (walking up the directory tree until
	  a suitable directory is found).

	* [r429] test/image-tests/read-write.php, test/number.php: With
	  SimpleTest 1.0.1alpha3 we no longer need to tell which test
	  cases to ignore, declaring them abstract is enough.

2006-07-14  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r428] .cvsignore: Remove left-over .cvsignore file.

2006-07-11  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r427] test/ifd.php: Added small test cases for SPL
	  functionality.

	* [r426] NEWS, PelJpeg.php, examples/edit-description.php: Added
	  PelJpeg::getExif() and setExif() methods. These convenience
	  methods should be used to read and write the Exif data stored in
	  the PelJpeg object since they will take care of ensuring that
	  there is exactly one Exif section.

	* [r425] examples/edit-description.php: Make edit-description.php
	  use the new setExif() method.

	* [r424] test/image-tests/read-write.php, test/number.php: There
	  seems to be a change in the way one tells SimpleTest to ignore a
	  class...

	* [r423] test/test.php: Reworked test-driver. One can now give a
	  list of filenames on the command line, and then only those will
	  be loaded and run. If no arguments is given, then all tests are
	  run, as before.

	* [r422] PelJpeg.php: Added new simple method for adding Exif
	  data, please use setExif() instead of appendSection().

2006-05-13  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r421] examples/edit-description.php: The PelIfd constructor now
	  tages an IFD type as first argument. Thanks goes to Michael
	  Dempfle of TinyWebGallery for noticing this.

2006-02-20  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r420] NEWS: Document the documentation! :-)

	* [r419] PelEntryByte.php, PelEntryLong.php, PelEntryNumber.php,
	  PelEntryRational.php, PelEntryShort.php: Explicit name for
	  vararg parameter.

	* [r418] PelIfd.php: Document the ArrayAccess methods.

	* [r417] PelEntryRational.php: Cool, now I know how to spell
	  "numerator"...

2006-01-15  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r416] PelEntryAscii.php: Hmm... so now you cannot give a string
	  (like "42") to gmdate?!

	* [r415] test/ascii.php, test/number.php, test/undefined.php: I
	  get more errors with SimpleTest 1.0 and PHP 5.1.1, so update the
	  test cases to match.

	* [r414] Pel.php, PelIfd.php: Reformatting.

	* [r413] examples/dump-image.php: Fixed to use accessor functions.

	* [r412] test/ascii.php, test/number.php, test/undefined.php:
	  Updated test cases to work with SimpleTest 1.0, in which
	  assertError() matches on the exact error string.

	* [r411] PelTag.php: Fixed doubly defined XP_COMMENT constant.
	  Removed one of the two doubly defined CFA_PATTERN constants
	  which isn't mentioned in the Exif-2.2 standard (show me an image
	  with the other one and we can add it back).

2006-01-11  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r410] NEWS: Added news about the Japanese translation.

	* [r409] po/da.po, po/de.po, po/es.po, po/fr.po, po/ja.po,
	  po/pel.pot, po/pl.po: Updated Danish translation slightly.
	  Updated all files with GPS related strings and resynched line
	  numbers.

	* [r408] AUTHORS, po/ja.po: Added Japanese translation by Tadashi
	  Jokagi. Reordered names alphabetically.

2006-01-08  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r406] NEWS, make-release.sh: Ups! Two small last-minute fixes.

	* [r405] make-release.sh: My perl stopped working -- use sed
	  instead then...

	* [r404] make-release.sh: Get ready for PEL 0.9! :-)

	* [r403] tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg: Argh, fixed newlines in links...

	* [r402] TODO, test/image-tests/read-write.php, test/test.php:
	  Fixed read-write unit tests. It tests the DATE_TIME tags and
	  COPYRIGHT tag, though. But these are tested a bit in their own
	  core test case.

	* [r401] PelEntry.php, PelIfd.php: Cleaned the mess about
	  PelEntry::$ifd_type up a bit with proper getters and setters.
	  Added PelIfd::isValidTag() which has a concept of private tags
	  (those with values larger than 0xF000) useful for testing (as in
	  our unit tests).

	* [r400] NEWS: American English spell check.

	* [r399] tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg: Added an explaination about
	  commercial use of PEL. If anybody knows better on this subject,
	  then *please* contact me!

2005-10-23  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r398] TODO: Cleared JPEG comment TODO.

	* [r397] NEWS, PelJpeg.php, PelJpegComment.php: Support for JPEG
	  comments. Reading and writing those are done through the
	  PelJpegComment class which works very similarly to PelEntry with
	  a getValue() and a setValue() method.

	* [r396] PelException.php: Exception used by PelIfd.

	* [r395] tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg: Adding more method names should
	  make the question easier to find.

2005-10-16  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r394] PelIfd.php: Made PelIfd act like an array! So you can now
	  do things like $ifd[PelTag::IMAGE_WIDTH]->getValue() to get
	  access to the ImageWidth tag.
	  
	  Beware that you'll still have to check for the entry first, just
	  like with normal array.

2005-10-13  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r393] README, tutorials/PEL/PEL.pkg, tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg:
	  More info about the PHP 5 requirement.

2005-10-12  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r392] tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg: Updates to match
	  Pel::getExceptions(), and my try at making a funny FAQ! :-)

	* [r391] INSTALL: Added small paragraph on upgrading.

2005-10-11  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r390] PelEntryNumber.php, PelJpeg.php, PelTag.php: Small fixes
	  in the doc comments.

	* [r389] Pel.php, examples/dump-image.php,
	  test/image-tests/canon-ixus-ii.php,
	  test/image-tests/canon-powershot-s60.php,
	  test/image-tests/leica-d-lux.php,
	  test/image-tests/make-image-test.php,
	  test/image-tests/nikon-coolscan-iv.php,
	  test/image-tests/nikon-e5000.php,
	  test/image-tests/nikon-e950.php, test/image-tests/no-exif.php,
	  test/image-tests/olympus-c5050z.php,
	  test/image-tests/olympus-c50z.php,
	  test/image-tests/olympus-c765uz.php,
	  test/image-tests/pentax-istDS.php,
	  test/image-tests/read-write.php,
	  test/image-tests/sony-dsc-v1.php, test/number.php: Removed
	  public access to Pel::$debug and friends. Having them private is
	  cleaner and some PHP errors were reported coming from constructs
	  like Pel::$debug...

2005-10-06  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r388] NEWS, PelIfd.php, TODO: Iteration of PelIfd with
	  foreach().

2005-10-05  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r387] PelConvert.php, PelDataWindow.php: Remove unnecessary
	  calls by references since PHP will only copy data on write
	  anyway. Likewise for PelDataWindow: the PHP5 clone is faster and
	  uses the same amount of memory since a window is read-only.

2005-10-04  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r386] PelTag.php: Added titles and descriptions for all GPS
	  related tags.

	* [r385] TODO: Rearranged items per targeted release.

	* [r384] make-release.sh: Removed unnecessary anchor.

	* [r383] tutorials/PEL/PEL.pkg, tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg: Fixed EXIF
	  -> Exif, corrected phpdoc links.

	* [r382] ., .cvsignore, run-phpdoc.sh: A missing ChangeLog file
	  would make phpDocumentor skip all README, INSTALL, NEWS, etc.
	  files.

2005-10-03  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r381] tutorials/PEL/PEL.pkg, tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg,
	  tutorials/PEL/using.pkg: Aarrgh! Something weird happened with
	  PHP version 5.0.5... now the phpdoc XML parser suddenly decided
	  to interpret {@link xxx yyy} inside a comment?!
	  
	  As if the new trend in PHP 5.0.5 of throwing "Fatal error: Only
	  variables can be passed by reference" wasn't enough...

	  to follow the standard.

	* [r378] test/test.php: read-write.php is broken, skip for now.

	* [r377] Pel.php: Updated example to match new PelTag::getName()

	* [r376] PelTiff.php: Updated example to match new
	  PelIfd::getSubIfd().

	* [r375] NEWS, PelIfd.php, PelJpeg.php: Changed
	  PelIfd::getSubIfd() to take an IFD type as argument instead of a
	  PelTag. Added PelIfd::addSubIfd().

	* [r374] test/image-tests/canon-ixus-ii.php,

	  sub-IFDs by IFD type instead of tag.

	* [r373] NEWS, TODO: Latest changes: full support for GPS
	  information.

	* [r372] PelEntryRational.php: Handle GPS latitude and longitude.

	* [r371] PelTiff.php: Enforce IFD0 as first IFD in TIFF files.

	* [r370] PelEntry.php, PelIfd.php: Moved PelEntry::newFromData()
	  to PelIfd::newEntryFromData(), added PelIfd::getValidTags() for
	  enforcing standard compliance, began using constants denoting
	  different IFD types.

	* [r369] PelTag.php: Added GPS tags, Gamma tag, and PrintIM tag.
	  Reformatted.

	* [r368] PelJpeg.php: Removed unnecessary warning.

	* [r367] test/image-tests/canon-ixus-ii.php,

	  Pel::$exceptions array.

	* [r366] test/image-tests/make-image-test.php: Fixed so the right
	  class name is used instead of us trying to figure it out.

2005-10-01  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r365] test/image-tests/make-image-test.php: Updated to handle
	  the new strict/non-strict business: exceptions while parsing are
	  now checked too.

	* [r364] test/test.php: Update for new strict PHP5 handling of
	  temporary variables: the "only variables can be passed by
	  reference" error.

	* [r363] tutorials/PEL/faq.pkg: Answers to two questions nobody
	  has asked: how to get Gettext working and how to use the new
	  system with strict and non-strict parsing.

	* [r362] COPYING: Updated with current address of FSF.

	* [r361] examples/README, examples/dirsort.php,
	  examples/dump-image.php, examples/edit-description.php,
	  examples/rename.php: Changed paths in example shell scripts to
	  /usr/bin/php and explained in the README how to execute them.

2005-09-11  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r360] PelEntry.php: Added a $tag field to the PelEntryException.

	* [r359] PelException.php: Small consistancy fix.

	* [r358] Pel.php, PelEntryNumber.php, PelIfd.php, PelJpeg.php,
	  examples/dump-image.php, test/number.php: Added a flag
	  Pel::$strict which determines how hard PEL will try to continue
	  despite errors: when Pel::$strict is false, loading will
	  continue as far as possible.
	  
	  Exceptions will still be produced, but instead of being thrown
	  they are stored in Pel::$exceptions, which the user can check if
	  special error handling is required. See the description on
	  Pel::$exceptions.

	* [r357] TODO: Noted the problem with PelEntryWindowsString and
	  non Latin-1 characters. Added more details to all items.

	* [r356] PelIfd.php: Better (more detailed) debug output.

	* [r355] PelDataWindow.php: Wrong links in doc comments.

	* [r354] PelTag.php: Fixed indention and typos.

	* [r353] PelEntry.php, PelEntryByte.php, PelTag.php: Added support
	  for the non-standard Windows XP author, comment, title, subject,
	  and keywords tags. The tags are backed by a new class
	  PelEntryWindowsString which behaves like PelEntryAscii except
	  that it reads and writes the strings in the Microsoft format
	  instead of the standard EXIF ASCII format.

	* [r352] PelEntryAscii.php: Spelling inconsistancy: Subsec ->
	  SubSec.

	* [r351] examples/edit-description.php: Exit upon error.

2005-08-18  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r350] AUTHORS, NEWS: Added Jakub Bogusz as the author of the
	  Polish translation.

	* [r349] PelJpegMarker.php: Cutting down on the number of strings
	  to translate.

2005-08-17  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r348] po/da.po, po/de.po, po/es.po, po/fr.po, po/pel.pot,
	  po/pl.po: Some minor differences between PHP and C (such as
	  using %d instead of %i in format strings) had caused a number of
	  translations to be marked as "fuzzy". Added a couple of extra
	  translations to the Danish translation.

	* [r347] po/pl.po: Added Polish translation by Jakub Bogusz from
	  the libexif project.

	* [r346] PelEntryShort.php: Added support for Adobe RGB color
	  space. From libexif, see
	  
	  http://sf.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=12646603

	* [r345] PelTag.php: Incorporated updates to the doc comments by
	  Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@pld-linux.org> on libexif. See
	  
	  http://sf.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=12656443

2005-07-30  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r344] NEWS, examples/edit-description.php: Correctly add an
	  empty EXIF structure in case the original image has none.

	* [r343] PelJpeg.php: Hmm, I thought I had committed that: begone
	  evil getSite() method!

2005-07-19  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r342] NEWS: Document latest changes.

	* [r341] make-release.sh: Actually commit the change --- use
	  run-phpdoc.sh to generate API documentation.

	* [r340] PelJpegContent.php: Remove getSize() method. It produced
	  an error when called from the PelExif subclass and was not used.

	* [r339] PelExif.php, PelIfd.php, PelJpeg.php: Better doc comments
	  and small code cleanups.

	* [r338] PelEntry.php: Let PelEntry.php include the class
	  definitions of all the different types of entries. The problem
	  with the conditional inclusion of the files is that it works
	  fine when parsing a JPEG image --- files are included as needed
	  and everybody is happy.
	  
	  So any JPEG image can be parsed by simply including PelJpeg.php.
	  But if this PelJpeg object is stored somewhere---in a session
	  for example---then things break since PelJpeg only includes
	  which itself only includes PelEntry which didn't include any of
	  the real entry class definitions.

2005-07-09  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r337] PelDataWindow.php, PelEntryAscii.php, PelEntryLong.php,
	  PelEntryRational.php, PelIfd.php, PelTag.php: Removed
	  apostrophes from the doc comments.

2005-07-08  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r336] PelEntryAscii.php, PelEntryUndefined.php, PelIfd.php: Why
	  did I use the self::func() form instead of the normal
	  $this->func() form? If somebody knows, then please remind me!

2005-06-29  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r335] PelEntry.php: Better output when an unexpected format is
	  found during loading.

	* [r334] README: Reworded.

	* [r333] PelIfd.php: Added a setThumbnail() method which does what
	  it says. Thanks goes to David Weingart for making me aware that
	  we needed such a function.

2005-05-29  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r332] NEWS: Updated with info about the newest commits.

	* [r331] PelTag.php: Updated doc comments with information about
	  the constrains on the format and number of component for each
	  tag.

	* [r330] PelFormat.php: Updated doc comments.

	* [r329] PelEntry.php: Updated documentation to make it clear that
	  newFromData() shouldn't be used to generate entries, except when
	  the data is from an image.

	* [r328] run-phpdoc.sh: An external script to run phpdoc with
	  consistant arguments.

2005-05-28  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r327] PelEntryShort.php: Fixed a typo in the example, reported
	  by the sharp-eyed Jeff Park.

2005-02-11  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r318] PelExif.php: Fixed another mis-spelled exception.

	* [r317] README, examples/README, test/README: Added README files
	  to the subdirectories to better explain to people what they are
	  all about.

	* [r316] examples/dirsort.php: A small example showing how to sort
	  photos into monthly directories.

	* [r315] examples, examples/dump-image.php,
	  examples/edit-description.php, examples/rename.php,
	  test/dump-image.php, test/edit-description.php, test/rename.php:
	  Moved example scripts from the 'test' directory to a new
	  'examples' directory.

2005-02-10  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r314] test/test.php: Fixed the inclusion of tests from the
	  'image-tests' directory so that the make-image-test.php script
	  wont be mistaken for a test case. Updated the copyright
	  statement to include year 2005.

	* [r313] TODO: Added a note about investigating the JPEG comment
	  section, and updated the copyright statement to include year
	  2005.

	  file anyway.

	* [r309] test/image-tests/README: Updated copyright statement to
	  year 2005, reworded slightly.

2005-02-06  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r308] NEWS, PelEntry.php, PelIfd.php, PelTag.php: Instead of
	  aborting on erranous entries, they are now skipped.

	* [r307] test/rename.php: Added comments to explain what this
	  script actually does.

	* [r306] NEWS: Described the latest changes.

2005-01-30  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r305] test/edit-description.php: Added lots of comments to make
	  this a better example.

	  be validated up against this known good state.

2005-01-29  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r303] test/edit-description.php: Wrong class name --- there has
	  never been a PelEntryString class, it was always PelEntryAscii.

	* [r302] AUTHORS, test/image-tests/leica-d-lux-thumb.jpg,

	* [r297] Pel.php, PelEntryNumber.php, PelExif.php, PelJpeg.php,

	  tests into their own file.

	* [r293] NEWS: Latest news about PEL version 0.7.

	  value and the formatted value is printed.

	* [r291] test/image-tests/canon-powershot-s60-thumb.jpg,
	  test/image-tests/canon-powershot-s60.php: Test case for the
	  Canon PowerShot S60 image.

	* [r290] INSTALL, README, test/image-tests/README: Updated
	  instructions on how to contribute test images.

	* [r289] Pel.php: Added doc comments for the stub dgettext()
	  function.

	* [r288] test/test.php: Give a proper warning if people try to run
	  the tests without having downloaded the image tests.

	* [r287] test/test.php: Moved tests to the image-tests directory.
	  Any file ending with '.php' in that directory will be added as a
	  GroupTest.

	  test/image-tests/sony-dsc-v1.jpg,

	* [r285] test/canon-ixus-ii.php, test/images,
	  test/nikon-coolscan-iv.php, test/nikon-e5000.php,
	  test/nikon-e950.php, test/read-write.php, test/sony-dsc-v1.php:
	  These files are being moved to a new image-tests directory.

	* [r284] PelConvert.php, PelEntryLong.php, PelEntryShort.php: The
	  internal handling of large integers (larger than 2^31-1 =
	  2147483647, which is the largest integer that can be represented
	  in the signed 32 bit integers that PHP use) has been changed
	  between PHP version 5.0.1 and 5.0.2.
	  
	  The change manifests itself when the arguments to operators like
	  >> and % and functions like chr() is too large: previously this
	  would go unnoticed, but now the argument is clipped to 2^31-1.
	  
	  For example, this means that 0xFFFFFFFF >> 24 gives 0xFF in
	  version 5.0.1, but 0x7F in version 5.0.2 where it looks as if
	  the left argument is first clipped to 0x7FFFFFFF (the largest
	  signed 32 bit integer) and then shifted as expected.
	  
	  Using base_convert() instead of the shift and modulo operations
	  gives correct results in both new and older versions of PHP 5.

	* [r283] AUTHORS: Added Mikkel Kr�ig�rd to the list of test image
	  contributors.

	* [r282] test/images/canon-powershot-s60.jpg: New test image taken
	  with a Canon PowerShot S60 by Mikkel Kr�ig�rd.

	* [r281] README: Linked to the SourceForge Patch Tracker so that
	  people know where to submit test images for PEL.

	* [r280] make-release.sh: PEL is now also listed on NeedScripts.

	* [r279] INSTALL: Added links to Debian packages and Windows
	  binaries with PHP 5.

2004-10-04  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r278] PelConvert.php: Some EXIF papers prefer to talk about
	  Intel (little-endian) and Motorola (big-endian) byte orders, so
	  it is convenient if the doc comments tells you which is which.

2004-09-27  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r277] NEWS: Added a little description of the Gettext
	  work-around.

2004-09-13  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r276] Pel.php: When there is no dgettext() function, we create
	  a stub. This should allow PEL to run in environments without
	  support for Gettext. PEL will then run with the default English
	  texts. This should fix the error reported in bug #1022143.

2004-08-11  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r275] test/rename.php: A test script illustrating how PEL can
	  be used to mass-rename files accourding to their timestamps.

2004-08-02  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r274] README: Added instructions on how to contribute test
	  images.

	  Updated to match new interface in PelJpeg. Fixed timestamps to
	  match the UTC time.

	* [r261] PelEntry.php: The timestamps should be treated uniformly
	  as UTC time, and not local time, otherwise we cannot guarantee a
	  safe round trip where an entry is written to a file and then
	  later retrieved.

	* [r260] test/read-write.php: New tests of PelEntryAscii and its
	  descendent classes.

	* [r259] test/edit-description.php: Updated to match interface
	  changes in PelJpeg.

	* [r257] PelExif.php, PelIfd.php, PelJpeg.php, PelTiff.php: New
	  infrastructure that allows one to construct empty objects, and
	  then later add content.

	* [r256] test/test.php: Link in the new test cases.

	* [r255] PelException.php: The PelInvalidDataException is a new
	  generic exception when invalid data is found.

	* [r254] test/read-write.php: Test cases covering reading and
	  writing files.

	* [r253] NEWS, PelConvert.php: The conversion from bytes to signed
	  shorts were off by one.

	* [r252] NEWS, PelEntry.php: The loading of signed bytes was wrong.

	* [r251] PelEntry.php: Check the format before trying to load the
	  data.

2004-07-20  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r250] NEWS, PelJpegMarker.php: Rename
	  PelJpegMarker::isValidMarker() into PelJpegMarker::isValid().

	  PelJpeg::isValid() and PelTiff::isValid() is better described as
	  functions than methods.

	* [r248] TODO: New plans.

2004-07-18  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	  image has the date and time delimited with '.' instead of ':' as
	  specified by the Exif standard.

2004-07-17  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r235] test/images/nikon-coolscan-iv.jpg: A sample image from a
	  Nikon Coolscan IV ED film scanner.

2004-07-10  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r234] test/images/canon-ixus-ii-thumb.jpg,
	  test/images/canon-ixus-ii.jpg,
	  test/images/sony-dsc-v1-thumb.jpg, test/images/sony-dsc-v1.jpg:
	  New images, taken directly from the cameras instead of being
	  resized in the Gimp.

	* [r233] test/images/nikon-e5000-thumb.jpg,
	  test/images/nikon-e5000.jpg, test/images/nikon-e950-thumb.jpg,
	  test/images/nikon-e950.jpg: New test images from Nikon models
	  E950 and E5000.

	* [r232] test/dump-image.php, test/edit-description.php: The
	  scripts could only be run from the test directory because of the
	  use of relative paths in the require_once() statements.

2004-07-09  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r231] NEWS: Descriptions of the latest changes since version
	  0.5 was released.

2004-06-29  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r230] test/edit-description.php: Updated code to match the
	  changes in PelJpeg::getSection().

	* [r229] PelException.php: Updated doc comments.

	* [r228] PelJpeg.php: Fixed converting PelJpeg objects into bytes.
	  Updated the doc comments to match the latest changes in the code.

	* [r227] PelTiff.php: Having a default byte order is convenient
	  --- little-endian byte order was chosen arbitrarily.

2004-06-28  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r226] test/number.php: The new tests that caught the missing
	  return statement.

	* [r225] PelEntryRational.php: The output generated in the default
	  case was not returned, and so one did not get the expected 'x/y'
	  text for a plain rational number.

	* [r223] make-release.sh: The Perl code was wrong.

	* [r222] NEWS: Version 0.5 is out.

	* [r221] make-release.sh: PEL version 0.5 is coming soon to a
	  mirror near you!

	* [r220] users: A file for manual translation of SourceForge
	  usernames to real names.

	* [r219] po/pel.pot: Regenerated with updated line numbers.

	* [r218] NEWS, TODO: Hurray! PEL should now be fully documented.

	* [r217] PelJpeg.php, PelTiff.php: Updated doc comments.

2004-06-27  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r216] PelExif.php: Added doc comments.

	* [r215] NEWS: Bug #976782 should now finally be dealt with.

	* [r214] PelJpeg.php: Some images have some content following the
	  EOI marker --- that content is now stored as a PelJpegContent
	  object associated with the fictive marker 0x00. All the images
	  reported in bug #976782 can now be parsed by PEL.

	* [r213] PelIfd.php: The thumbnails would lack the very last byte,
	  fixed.

	* [r212] PelDataWindow.php: Fixed indention.

	* [r211] PelIfd.php: Fixes for images with broken length
	  information for the thumbnail.

	* [r210] PelTag.php: Added some links in the doc comments.

2004-06-26  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r209] INSTALL, NEWS, README: Removed the apostrophes in
	  contractions.

	* [r208] make-release.sh: PEL got added to another online
	  directory.

	* [r207] INSTALL, NEWS, Pel.php, PelConvert.php,
	  PelDataWindow.php, PelEntry.php, PelEntryAscii.php,
	  PelEntryByte.php, PelEntryLong.php, PelEntryNumber.php,
	  PelEntryRational.php, PelEntryShort.php, PelEntryUndefined.php,
	  PelException.php, PelExif.php, PelFormat.php, PelIfd.php,

	  test/sony-dsc-v1.php, test/test.php, test/undefined.php,
	  update-locales.sh, update-pot.sh: Updated the standard file
	  prefix now that PEL can parse TIFF images.

	* [r206] NEWS: Updated with news about the progress of fixing bug
	  #976782.

2004-06-25  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r205] PelConvert.php: Another off-by-one bug!

	* [r204] test/convert.php: Extensive tests of longs, shorts, and
	  bytes.

	* [r203] test/convert.php, test/test.php: Added tests of the
	  conversion of bytes into integers, with emphasis on the
	  conversion of bytes to large integers.

	* [r202] test/data-window.php: Added a test case to exercise the
	  parsing of big integers, that is, integers that overflow a
	  signed 32 bit integer.

2004-06-24  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r201] PelConvert.php: The bytesToLong() method didn't work
	  correctly with integers larger that would overflow the PHP
	  signed 32 bit integers. But when multiplying and adding the
	  integers are promoted to 64 bit floats, which can then be used
	  in place of a true unsigned 32 bit integer type.

	* [r200] PelEntryNumber.php: The %d format specifier converts the
	  argument into a signed 32 bit integer --- the %f format
	  specifier works with 64 bit floats and so it can be used when
	  faking 32 bit unsigned integers.

	* [r199] PelJpeg.php: Remove the private $count variable.

	* [r198] PelExif.php, PelJpeg.php, PelJpegContent.php: Removed
	  PelJpegSection from the doc comments.

	* [r197] test/canon-ixus-ii.php, test/sony-dsc-v1.php: Updated to
	  match the newly changed PelJpeg::getSection() method.

	* [r196] PelJpeg.php, PelJpegSection.php: Removed the
	  PelJpegSection class, since it was just acting as a simple pair.
	  This lead to a rewrite of the PelJpeg::getSection() method, so
	  that it now takes a PelJpegMarker as argument instead of the
	  section number. Added doc comments as well.

	* [r195] PelTiff.php: The byte order can now be specified when
	  turning a TIFF object into bytes. This makes the private $order
	  variable unnecessary. Added and updated doc comments.

2004-06-21  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r194] NEWS: News for the next release.

	* [r193] PelJpeg.php: Catch the exception thrown if the APP1 data
	  cannot be parsed as EXIF data. This fixes #976782.

	* [r192] PelEntry.php: Ups! The size of a byte is... one byte!

	* [r191] PelConvert.php: Fixed spelling mistakes in doc comments.

	* [r190] test/dump-image.php: Non-debug output didn't work.

	* [r189] test/dump-image.php: New -d argument will turn on
	  debugging.

	* [r188] PelIfd.php: Fixed getBytes() so that the byte order
	  argument now actually is used. Added doc comments.

	* [r187] Pel.php, PelEntry.php, PelEntryRational.php: Added and
	  updated doc comments.

	* [r186] PelDataWindow.php, PelEntryNumber.php: Added doc comments.

2004-06-11  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r185] INSTALL: Added a note about PEL being tested with PHP5
	  RC3.

2004-06-10  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r184] make-release.sh: PEL is now listed at
	  http://www.scripts.com/.

	* [r183] PelTiff.php: Added a simple getByteOrder() method.

	* [r182] TODO: Dropped the idea about making PEL a replacement for
	  the builtin PHP functions. This is because they don't depend on
	  anything outside PHP, so one would expect them to be available
	  in most PHP installations, and second, the output will be
	  somewhat tedious to reproduce.

2004-06-09  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r181] make-release.sh: The HTML ChangeLog is now modified
	  (using Perl magic) to contain proper anchors indicating each
	  release, so that the release notest can link to the proper
	  section. Added comments.

	* [r180] TODO: Another goal for PEL: handle USER_COMMENT tags
	  correctly, including converting to and from specified encodings.

	* [r178] NEWS, make-release.sh: Version 0.4 is out.

	* [r177] po/da.po: Last updates to the Danish translation before
	  version 0.4 is out.

	* [r176] make-release.sh: Updated so to generate locales for
	  inclusion with releases. Added a list of sites where new
	  releases of PEL can be announced.

	* [r175] po/da.po: Adjustments to the output.

	* [r174] PelJpeg.php, po/pel.pot: Small white-space adjustments to
	  the output.

	* [r173] po/da.po: Massive updates.

	* [r172] po/pel.pot: Updates with new string from
	  PelDataWindow.php and changes from PelFormat.php.

	* [r171] PelDataWindow.php: Found yet another string that is
	  eligible for translation.

	* [r170] PelFormat.php: Better output when the getName() and
	  getSize() functions are presented with an unknown format.

	* [r169] PelEntry.php, PelEntryAscii.php: Code cleanups, albeit
	  small ones...

	* [r168] NEWS: More news.

	* [r167] PelDataWindow.php: Indention.

	* [r166] po/pel.pot: Remove the generic strings which are no
	  longer marked as translatable in teh source.

	* [r165] NEWS: Note the Danish translation.

	* [r164] README: Reworded.

	* [r163] INSTALL: Explaination of the fact that PEL is a library
	  and not an application.

	* [r162] PelFormat.php, PelTag.php: The names of EXIF formats and
	  EXIF tags are generic terms which shouldn't be translated after
	  all.

2004-06-08  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r161] po/da.po, po/pel.pot: The latest strings, and the latest
	  Danish translations.

	* [r160] PelTag.php: Fixed capitalisation.

	* [r159] PelEntryShort.php: Added punctuation.

2004-06-06  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r158] PelTag.php: Added a couple of links in the doc comments.

	* [r157] PelFormat.php: Added doc comments.

	* [r156] po/da.po: Lots of updates for the Danish translation.

	* [r155] po/pel.pot: Merged in the newest strings.

	* [r154] Pel.php, update-locales.sh: Updated to match the new
	  pel.pot/pel.mo naming scheme.

	* [r153] po/PEL.pot: Renamed to pel.po.

	* [r152] update-pot.sh: Updated to match the new name for the po
	  template file.

	* [r151] po/pel.pot: Renamed from PEL.pot to pel.pot since I
	  actually like lower-case filenames better.

	* [r150] PelEntryRational.php: Another couple of strings which
	  should be translated.

	* [r149] NEWS: Note the disabling of GPS related tags.

	* [r148] PelTag.php: Added doc comments to the class constants ---
	  the comments are the corresponding titles and descriptions as
	  given by the functions getTitle() and getDescription().
	  
	  The code for finding the tile and description of the GPS related
	  tags were commented out. These tags seem to conflict with a
	  number of other tags, e.g., the tags have the same hexadecimal
	  value, so they have to be treated specially somehow.

	* [r147] PelFormat.php: Marked the names of EXIF entry formats as
	  translatable.

	* [r146] PelEntryUndefined.php: Added translatable strings for the
	  version tags.

	* [r145] PelEntryShort.php: This was broken, the call to
	  Pel::tra() lacked the final ). Also added required files to the
	  require_once() block.

2004-06-05  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r144] PelEntryShort.php: This makes the output for the
	  SUBJECT_AREA tag translatable.

	* [r143] PelEntryAscii.php: Mark more translatable strings.

	* [r142] po/PEL.pot: Updated with the new strings from the
	  PelTag.php file.

	* [r141] INSTALL: Changed the example to use require_once()
	  instead of include_once() since the intented semantics is to
	  really fail if the files cannot be read --- continuing with a
	  warning is no good.

	* [r140] README: Added note about internationalisation, and
	  credited the libexif project for providing the translations.

	* [r139] NEWS: Note the new internationalisation stuff.

	* [r138] po/de.po, po/es.po, po/fr.po: Added German, Spanish, and
	  French translations made by Lutz M�ller, Fabian Mandelbaum, and
	  Arnaud Launay, respectively. The translations were made for the
	  libexif project, but since PEL is a port of that project, the
	  translations can be used here too.

2004-06-04  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r137] PelEntryShort.php, PelTag.php: More strings marked for
	  translation. Some of the strings were split across several lines
	  in the source, but they are now all on single (but unfortunately
	  very long) lines, because the xgettext program couldn't extract
	  the splitted strings properly.

	* [r136] po/PEL.pot, po/da.po: Added new strings so that the
	  output of dump-image.php is mostly translatable. Updated the
	  Danish translation with translations for those strings.

	* [r135] PelEntry.php, PelExif.php, PelIfd.php, PelTag.php,
	  PelTiff.php: Marked string for translation and made the files
	  require Pel.php, which is needed by any file which contain
	  translatable strings.

	* [r134] po/PEL.pot: Updated with latest strings from PelJpeg.php.

	* [r133] po/da.po: Translations...

	* [r132] PelJpeg.php: Mark strings for translation.

	* [r131] TODO: The internationalization process has now been
	  started, so this TODO item can be removed.

	* [r130] ., .cvsignore: Ignore the auto-generated locale directory.

	* [r129] test/dump-image.php: Enable the use of Gettext.

	* [r128] PelJpegMarker.php: Marked more strings for translation.

	* [r127] PelTag.php: Mark string for translation.

	* [r126] po/da.po: Preliminary Danish translation of PEL.

	* [r125] po, po/PEL.pot: The template PO file on which other
	  translations are based. Translators should merge this file into
	  their own translations whenever this file is updated.

	* [r124] update-locales.sh: Maintaince script for generating MO
	  files. All PO files in the po subdirectory will be processed and
	  the result will be put in the corresponding directory under the
	  locale subdirectory.

	* [r123] update-pot.sh: Maintaince script for updating the PO
	  template file po/PEL.pot. This is the file containing all the
	  string that are marked for translation in PEL. Translators
	  should merge it into their translations whenever it is updated.

	* [r122] Pel.php: Added two new static functions for
	  internationalization. This is the beginning of making PEL speak
	  other languages than just English.

	* [r121] PelEntryShort.php: Wrong format codes used: PHP does not
	  have %i. This was found using Gettext which knows about the
	  valid PHP format specifiers... cool!

	* [r120] PelEntryAscii.php: Fixed more spelling mistakes.

2004-05-28  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r119] Pel.php, PelConvert.php, PelDataWindow.php, PelEntry.php,
	  PelEntryNumber.php, PelEntryRational.php, PelEntryShort.php,
	  PelJpeg.php, PelTag.php, README, TODO: Spell check.

2004-05-25  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r118] NEWS, PelJpegContent.php: As always: added doc comments.

	* [r116] make-release.sh: Version 0.3 is out.

	* [r115] NEWS: Last minute updated before version 0.3 is out.

	* [r114] INSTALL: Updated example to match the new class and
	  method names.

	  comments.

	  PelJpegSection.php: Added standard doc comments for

	  Added standard doc comments for require_once blocks.

	* [r106] Pel.php, PelConvert.php: Updated doc comments.

	* [r105] NEWS, README: Announce support for TIFF images and other
	  changes.

	* [r104] test/canon-ixus-ii.php, test/sony-dsc-v1.php: Added extra
	  indirection due to the new class structure where the PelExif
	  object holds a PelTiff object with the real data.

	* [r103] test/ascii.php: The class was renamed to
	  PelEntryCopyright.

	* [r102] PelEntry.php, PelEntryAscii.php, PelEntryByte.php,
	  PelEntryLong.php, PelEntryNumber.php, PelEntryRational.php,
	  PelEntryShort.php, PelEntryUndefined.php, PelFormat.php,
	  PelIfd.php, PelJpegContent.php, PelJpegMarker.php,
	  PelJpegSection.php, PelTag.php: Removed @subpackage tags except
	  for the exceptions. This gives a better overview in the
	  documentation.

	* [r101] test/dump-image.php: Updated to handle both JPEG and TIFF
	  images.

	* [r100] PelJpeg.php, PelTiff.php: Added PelTiff for parsing TIFF
	  files and added an isValid() method to both classes so that it's
	  easy to test unknown data to see if it's JPEG or TIFF data.

	* [r99] PelExif.php: Updated to use a PelTiff object as the
	  internal representation of the EXIF data.

	* [r98] PelDataWindow.php: Added extra check on the offset given.

2004-05-24  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r97] test/canon-ixus-ii.php, test/dump-image.php,
	  test/edit-description.php, test/sony-dsc-v1.php, test/test.php:
	  Updated to match the newly renamed classes.

	  exif-entry-number.php to just number.php

	* [r94] test/ascii.php, test/exif-entry-ascii.php: Renamed
	  exif-entry-ascii.php to just ascii.php

	* [r93] Pel.php: More flexible control of the debug output. This
	  should probably be turned into a general scheme with a verbosity
	  level.

	* [r92] PelJpeg.php, PelJpegData.php: Renamed PelJpegData.php to
	  PelJpeg.php

	* [r91] PelExif.php, PelExifData.php: Renamed PelExifData.php to
	  PelExif.php

	  to PelEntry.php

	* [r79] PelExifEntryRational.php: Removed old TODO.

	* [r78] TODO: Parsing TIFF images would be a nice feature for
	  completeness.

	* [r77] PelExifData.php: The size of the EXIF data was checked
	  several times, these checks are now combined into one check.

2004-05-22  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r76] INSTALL: Some information about SimpleTest.

	* [r75] make-release.sh: Added standard header to the ChangeLog
	  file.

	* [r74] NEWS: Making test cases with SimpleTest is easy ---
	  there's now over 400 tests included with PEL!

	* [r73] test/test.php: Add the new tests.

2004-05-21  Martin Geisler <mgeisler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r72] test/canon-ixus-ii.php,
	  test/images/canon-ixus-ii-thumb.jpg,
	  test/images/canon-ixus-ii.jpg: Test images and unit tests for
	  Canon IXUS II.

	* [r62] PelExifEntryUndefined.php: Fixed output of integer version
	  numbers: version 2.0 would be output as just version 2.

	  not $this->numbers. Or at least that's how it's supposed to be.

	* [r54] PelDataWindow.php: Added doc comment for the clear()
	  method --- this method is for debugging only.

	* [r53] test/exif-entry-ascii.php, test/exif-entry-number.php,
	  test/exif-entry-undefined.php: Added forgotten ?> to the files.

	* [r52] NEWS: Document the include_once() -> require_once() change.

	* [r51] PelDataWindow.php, PelExifData.php, PelExifEntry.php,

	  PelExifEntryUndefined.php, PelExifIfd.php, PelJpegContent.php,
	  PelJpegData.php, PelJpegSection.php: Don't just try to include
	  the files, we actually require those files to be able to run.

	* [r50] Pel.php: Added a Pel::warning() function which is used for
	  what one would expect in the code. The warnings are only output
	  if PEL_DEBUG is defined to a true value, perhaps this should be
	  changed.

	* [r49] PelExifIfd.php: Re-enabled debug output, using the
	  Pel::debug() function.

	* [r48] NEWS: Re-filled paragraphs, and made room for post-0.2

	* [r35] PelExifEntryRational.php: The PelExifEntryRational and
	  PelExifEntrySRational classes now work like the other numeric
	  EXIF entry classes --- each number (rational) is represented as
	  an two-element array. Updated doc comments.

	* [r34] PelExifEntryByte.php, PelExifEntryLong.php,
	  PelExifEntryNumber.php, PelExifEntryShort.php: Updated doc
	  comments.

	  PelExifEntryUndefined classes.

	  class.

	* [r28] NEWS, README: Added note about SimpleTest and other new
	  things.

	* [r27] test/exif-entry.php: Test cases for the subclasses of
	  PelExifEntry. The tests will test for proper range checking
	  (overflows) and test that values can be retrieved correctly.

	* [r26] test/test.php: The main SimpleTest file --- run this and
	  all tests will be executed.

	* [r25] PelJpegData.php: Make use of the new Pel::debug() method
	  for output.

	* [r24] Pel.php: A class full of misc methods.

	  the number classes. Delayed including the class definitions of
	  the PelExifEntry* classes until they are needed.

	* [r21] PelExifEntryNumber.php: Changed the getNumbers and

	  be the new standard way of retrieving and changing the value of
	  any descendant of PelExifEntry.

	  and setNumbers methods to getValue and setValue, respectively,
	  to match the change in PelExifEntryNumber.

	  unsigned bytes.

	* [r17] PelDataWindow.php: Added methods to read signed numbers.
	  Added and updated doc comments.

	  shorts, and longs) are now handled correctly.
