<h1>Clubs Howto</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How clubs work / what features are present</h2>
<p><br />
The clubs feature work like this: </p>
<p>1) The pilot submits his flight as usual to leonardo, there is no difference at this stage.</p>
<p>2) The flight is displayed in the &quot;main&quot;   leoanrdo, and counted in the general scoring / xc league.</p>
<p>3) If the pilot is a member of a club (or more clubs) his flight will also appear in the scoring/league <br />
of his club. There is the option for clubs not to count each amd every flight of their members <br />
but give the club admin the possibility to add/delete flights manually. See <strong>&quot;addManual</strong>&quot; option below. </p>
<p>This is the basic functionallity that is present at the moment.</p>
<h2>Things/features to be done</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>noSpecificMembers</strong>: If set to 1 the club admin will not have to add pilots manually. Instead pilots will automatically belong to a club based on some criteria (nationalty or DHV category of their glider etc...) </li>
  <li><strong>defaultDisplayTheme </strong>A club may have a totally different apearance by using a diefferent theme.</li>

<p>Edit file site/config_clubs.php
  
  There are the club definitions. 
  Here is a typical entry:</p>

 &quot;id&quot;=&gt;1,
 &quot;lang&quot;=&gt;&quot;mexican&quot;,
 &quot;areaID&quot;=&gt;0,
 &quot;addManual&quot;=&gt;1,
 &quot;adminID&quot;=&gt;76,
 ) ,</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1=&gt;array( <br />
</strong>1 is the club ID, no clubs can have the same ID. <br />
    <strong><br />    &quot;desc&quot;=&gt;&quot;Broken Thermal Club&quot;,</strong><br /> 
      The description that will apear on the menu. Try to be brief, and not exceed 40-50 letters.</p>

</strong>The Id of the club as before </p>
<p><strong> &quot;lang&quot;=&gt;&quot;mexican&quot;,<br />
  </strong>The default language that will be displayed.<br />
    Different clubs can have different default languages,usefule in a multinational leonardo server </p>
<p><strong>&quot;areaID&quot;=&gt;0,<br />
</strong>Not used at the moment, leave it 0. It will be used when there is possibility to define Areas as <br />
a group of takeoffs and restrain the club fligths to takeoffs of this area </p>
<p><strong> &quot;addManual&quot;=&gt;1,</strong><br />
The most imporant setting: If is set to 0, all the flights that are submited to leonardo by club<br />
members are counted in the club league. <br />
If set to 1, a member must submit his flight to leonardo, but wont be automatically added to the club.<br />
The admin must manually add the flight via a special interface. </p>
<p><strong> &quot;adminID&quot;=&gt;76,</strong><br />
The user id of the administrator of this club. The club admin can add/remove pilots to the club<br />
and if &quot;addManual&quot; (see above ) is set to 1 he can also add/delete flights for the club. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add as many entries as this , each with a different clubID. </p>
