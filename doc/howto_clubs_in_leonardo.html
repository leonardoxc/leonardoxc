<h1>How 'Clubs/Leagues' work in Leonardo</h1>

<h2>What is a &quot;CLUB&quot; in Leonardo </h2>
<p>The &quot;CLUB&quot; is nothing more than a &quot;special filter&quot; that presents the desired flights.</p>
<p>You can consider the &quot;CLUB&quot; as a filter that is always active, all usual functions of Leonardo are working with the &quot;CLUB&quot; , the difference being that you are operating on the defined subset of flights that are part of the &quot;CLUB&quot;. So for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the List of flights, you only see the &quot;CLUB&quot; flights, all other filters of Leonardo <strong>can also be used to refine even further the display</strong></li>
  <li>In Takeoff list / Takeoff Guide , you see only the the takeoffs used by the &quot;CLUB&quot; flights</li>
  <li>In Pilot list you see only the Pilots that have submitted at least one &quot;CLUB&quot; flight (&quot;Club&quot; members that have<strong> not submited a flight wont be listed</strong>) </li>
  <li>In the &quot;XC League&quot; you see the 6 best flights from the &quot;CLUB&quot; flights </li>
</ul>
<p>This has of course some limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You cant make a &quot;CLUB&quot; present different infomation other than the one displayed in the general Leoanrdo listings</li>
  <li>You cant use a different scoring algorithm other than the one used by Leonardo </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'CLUB' feature of Leonardo can also be found as </p>
<ul>
  <li>'Custom League' </li>
  <li>'Club League' </li>
</ul>
<p>We will use in this document the term 'CLUB' </p>
<h2>How a &quot;CLUB&quot; work </h2>
<p><br />
The 'CLUB' feature work like this: </p>
<p>1) The pilot submits his flight as usual to leonardo, there is no difference at this stage.</p>
<p>2) The flight is displayed in the &quot;main&quot;   leoanrdo, and counted in the general scoring / xc league.</p>
<p>3) If the pilot is a member of a club (or more clubs) his flight will also appear in the scoring/league <br />
of his 'CLUB'. </p>
<p>The decision on wether a specific flight will be included in the 'CLUB' list is taken based on the option of &quot;CLUB MODE&quot;</p>
<h2><strong>&quot;CLUB MODE&quot;</strong></h2>
<p>There are 2 basic modes of operation for a 'CLUB' </p>
<p><strong>Automatic Mode </strong></p>
<p>All the flights that are submited to leonardo by club 
  members are counted in the club league.The administrator or/and the pilot cannot prevent a flight froma apearing in the 'CLUB' listings and scorings. The flights are automaticaly included in the 'CLUB' when the pilot submits his flight in the normal way in Leonardo main &quot;Add flight&quot; page. </p>
<p>In automatic Mode you have 2 more options: </p>
<h3> A defned Pilot List </h3>
<p>The most common case: The Administrator of the &quot;CLUB&quot; adds each club member manually. </p>
<h3>Automatic List of Pilots</h3>
<p>This can be used when the &quot;CLUB&quot; is not a club in the common meaning but rather we want to group flights by a specific Country/Nationality/Region </p>
<p>The current option for grouping &quot;Automatic List of Pilots&quot; are :</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Country</strong> of Flight or <strong>Area</strong> </li>
  <li>Nationality of Pilot</li>
  <li>An Area    </li>
</ol>
<p>The Area in Leonardo can be one of two things:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	A collection of takeoffs already in the database ( i.e. takeoff ids 1,56,23,102 etc...) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>or </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A rectangular Area </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the moment no other way to define an <strong>Area</strong> is present </p>
<p><strong>Manual Mode</strong><br />
  A member will ubmit his flight to leonardo in the normalway (Via the  &quot;Add flight&quot; page), but it wont be automatically added to the &quot;CLUB&quot;.<br />
  The admin must manually add the flight via a special interface. This requires more work from the admin but gives exact control to what flights arecounted and what not.</p>
<h2><strong>Administrator of the 'CLUB'</strong></h2>
<p>  The administrator of this club. The club admin can add/remove pilots to the club<br />
  and if &quot;Manual Mode&quot; (see above ) is selected, he can also add/delete flights for the club. </p>
<h2>SEASONS OF THE &quot;CLUB&quot; </h2>
<p>You have the option of choosing the way you count a season : either with calendar years ( ie 2008, 2009 etc)</p>
<p>or define the start - end dates of your season  </p>
<h2>Request for setting up your &quot;CLUB&quot;</h2>
<p>You must contact the Leonardo Administrator and provide him with the following information </p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of your club ( 1-5 words) in English </li>
  <li>The name of your club ( 1-5 words) in Your local language</li>
  <li>A short description of your &quot;CLUB&quot; in English  </li>
  <li>A short description of your &quot;CLUB&quot; in Local Language</li>
  <li>What is your Local Language </li>
  <li>The userID of the administrator of the club </li>
  <li>The contact email of the administrator</li>
  <li>Optionally the URL of a website that is related to this &quot;CLUB&quot; </li>
  <li>The &quot;Club Mode&quot; you wish to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you select &quot;CLUB MODE&quot; =&gt; AUTOMATIC you may want to select some more options: </p>
