How to prepare Satellite maps for Leoanrdo.



How to crop MrSID maps and use them as JPEG in Leonardo

 

ILS GeoViewer v1.0 (get it from: http://www.landsystems.com/Download/Download.htm )

 
The ILS GeoViewer demo version will run for a total of 4 hours in 30 minute 
session blocks with full functionality. That means we can crop 8 maps minimum 
because it does not check if the 30 minute session is over when it is cropping.

 

Install and run GeoViewer.

 

File -> New project

 

Click on the [+] to add a new layer and select the .SID file you want (I select 
the file: N-34-40_2000.SID for this example)

 

Tools -> Export

 

Res (m/pix): <note the number you see here> (I see 14,2500 for my file)

 

Tiling

Tile Cols: 10 (for my example)

Tile Rows: 19 (for my example)

 

change the above until you get the maximum number of pixels BUT
below  2048 pixels  x 2048 pixels

 

Parameters

File Type: JPEG

Colors: True Color

 
JPEG Compr.: 10 times (depends on the quality you want)
 

tick to Create World File(s)

tick to Create TAB File(s)

 

Click the [Export] button


  
 
  

Create a folder like 28_5/UTM34/40n/    for my example and point it there,

for filename I use N-34-40 for my example, click save and go for a coffee.


The folder I created  28_5/UTM34/40n/   N-34-40_1 means:

28_5 -> meters/pixels  the less meters/pixel the more detailed the map
UTM34 -> the UTM zone of the MRSID tile (34 for Greece , 33 for Italy etc)
40n -> (40 degrees latitude North)  the second number after the N form the filename (N-34-40 ...)
(put s for South hemisphere)
 

NOTE: Res (m/pix) How to use and change the "<note the number you see here>" number,

for maps 1/1 (100%) let it as is,

for maps 1/2 (50%) multiply that number by 2 and enter there the result, (I get 
14,2500 x 2 = 28,5 for my example)

for maps 1/4 (25%) multiply that number by 4 and enter there the result, (57 for 
my example)

for maps 1/8 (12.5%) multiply that number by 8 and enter there the result (114 
for my example).

 

This is the general idea.


FINAL NOTE :

you should prepare 3 directories : 
14_25  ( to show small flights in great details)
28_5   ( to show medium flights)
57    ( to show big XC )


You should prepare a maps directory in the modules/leonardo/  dir,  containing the above directory structure.
This directory should be in the server , (or your home PC or test platform) 
running leonardo. This is a one time only procedure to make the database, then you can move the 
maps directory in another server.

Open config.php and uncomment the line
$mapsPath=dirname(__FILE__)."/maps";
commenting out all other  $mapsPath lines. 


Now  open with your browser the admin.php (http://mysite.com/modules.php?name=leonardo&op=admin )
and click on the "Import Maps". this should prepare the database table "leonardo_maps".

You are now ready to go, you can move the maps/ dir to another server if you wish but dont forget to
edit config.php to point to the new path (examples included)


All new flights will be drawn with maps (if there is a map fot that area) and you can 
press "Update Flight Maps" form the admin menu (see above) to update ALL flights with the 
current map set. Caution : this is time and CPU intensive task, so do it at a non peak hour.
