  INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites in order to install Leonardo

1. PHP
2. Mysql
3. PHP Nuke OR phpBB running
4. GD 2.0 or higher installed in PHP (most free hosting dont offer that)
5. Ability to compile and execute C programs in the web server
6. 1 -5 Gb Hard disk space on the webserver for the SAT Maps
   (For greece, using a 14m/pixel map, 2.5 Gb were needed)

10. Basic - indermediate computer skills.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 AUTO INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- STEP 1. Unzip the files
  Unzip the files and place the files and directories to 
  modules/leonardo on the diretory of your phpBB or phpNuke installation.
  If you have installed phpBB on dir phpbb/ then the files should go to 
  phpbb/modules/leonardo. If you installing as a phpNuke module 
  use the modules/ directory of phpNuke.

- STEP 2.  Run the auto installer. at
 http://www.yourdomain.com/path_to_phpbb_or_nuke/modules/leonardo/install.php
 and follow the on-screen instructions.

- DONE Delete the install.php file

 MANUAL INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


- STEP 1. Unzip the files
  Unzip the files and place the files and directories to 
  modules/leonardo on the diretory of your phpBB or phpNuke installation.
  If you have installed phpBB on dir phpbb/ then the files should go to 
  phpbb/modules/leonardo. If you installing as a phpNuke module 
  use the modules/ directory of phpNuke.


- STEP 2. Create the tables
  Execute the file "leonardo.sql"  (found in the sql directory)
  to the sql server you are using. You can do this from the command 
  line interface (mysql) or using a web based tool (like phpmyAdmin)

  Execute the file "waypoints.sql"  in the same way as above. This will 
  add the coordinates of 3800 major world cities to get you started.

  For Standalone installations execute the file "standalone_extra_tables.sql".

- STEP 3. Edit modules/leonardo/config.php
   The 3 variables that you NEED to change are
   1)  $opMode 
	1 = for use with a PHPnuke portal
	2 = for use with a phBB2 forum
  3 = standalone -- still work in progress
  4 = for use with discuz
  5 = for use with joomla  1.0 and 1.5
  6 = for use with phpbb3

   2) $admin_users -> set this to the user id's (from the phpnuke table of users) 
                 that will have admin previledges


   You should deside which users will be admins for leonardo.
   those users will have the rights to delete any flight, modify any flight, 
   regenerate the maps and charts for any flight etc. Lets say that you are 
   user "admin" on your forum and want to put yourself in the $admin_users.
   Go to "MembersList " where all the members of your forum are displayed and
   search for "admin" When you find it and put the mouse cursor over "admin" 
   a link will be displayed in the bottom of the browser something like 
   "http://yoursite.com/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=230" Note the "u=230" ,
   so the user ID of user "admin" is 230 so put
       $admin_users=array(230);
   if you wish to add another user (lets say with user id 132) you should make this :
       $admin_users=array(230,132); 

   For a Standalone instalation this ID will probably be 1 if you're the first user
   to register.

   3) $OLCScoringServerPath -> set this to 
	http://www.mysite.com/modules/leonardo/server/scoreOLC.php
        where www.mysite.com is your site 

- STEP 4. setup a OLC Scoring Server
  1. go to dir modules/leonardo/server
  2. gcc -o olc -lm olc2002.c 

  You should have access to your web server in a shell
  and you should have access to compile and execute programs written in C.
  Check with your provider if you can do that. This is the program that
  scores a flight and because it needs to be fast it was written in C
  (a programming language) . If you can't run C programms in your web server
  then you will not be able to score the flights. In that case you should go to
  config.php and edit $scoringServerActive=1; to $scoringServerActive=0;
  so no scoring will be done. 

- STEP 5. 
    If you are	using phpNuke: 
	Activate the leonardo module from the phpHNuke administration panel

    If you are	using phpBB2:
	1) Copy the files install/phpbb2Files/modules.php and install/phpbb2Files/mainfile.php 
	to the root folder of your phpBB2 installation ( par example: phpbb/ )

	2) Open the file includes/constants.php  in your phpBB directory
	   Find 
		define('PAGE_GROUPCP', -11);
	   After that add 
		define('PAGE_LEONARDO', -1045);
	   Save the File

 
- STEP 6. Have fun. The URL of Leonardo to show all flights would be something like: 
     http://www.yoursite.com/path_to_phpbb_or_phpNuke/modules.php?name=leonardo&op=list_flights&sortOrder=DATE&year=0&month=0&pilotID=0
