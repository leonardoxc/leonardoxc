<? 
/*
An HGT file covers an area of 1x1. Its south western corner can
 be deduced from its file name: for example, 

n51e002.hgt covers the area between 
N 51 E 2 and N 52 E 3, 

and s14w077.hgt covers
S 14 W 77 to S 13 W 76. 
The file size depends on the resolution.


If this is 1", there are 3601 rows of 3601 cells each; 

*** If it is 3", there are 1201 rows of 1201 cells each. 

The rows are laid out like text on a page, starting with the northernmost row, with each row reading 
from west to east. 

Each cell has two bytes, and the elevation at that cell is 256*(1st byte) + (2nd byte). 
It follows that a 3" HGT file  has a file length of 2 x 1201 x 1201.
